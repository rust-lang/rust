// The main performance trick in this hashmap is called Robin Hood Hashing.
// It gains its excellent performance from one essential operation:
//
//    If an insertion collides with an existing element, and that element's
//    "probe distance" (how far away the element is from its ideal location)
//    is higher than how far we've already probed, swap the elements.
//
// This massively lowers variance in probe distance, and allows us to get very
// high load factors with good performance. The 90% load factor I use is rather
// conservative.
//
// > Why a load factor of approximately 90%?
//
// In general, all the distances to initial buckets will converge on the mean.
// At a load factor of α, the odds of finding the target bucket after k
// probes is approximately 1-α^k. If we set this equal to 50% (since we converge
// on the mean) and set k=8 (64-byte cache line / 8-byte hash), α=0.92. I round
// this down to make the math easier on the CPU and avoid its FPU.
// Since on average we start the probing in the middle of a cache line, this
// strategy pulls in two cache lines of hashes on every lookup. I think that's
// pretty good, but if you want to trade off some space, it could go down to one
// cache line on average with an α of 0.84.
//
// > Wait, what? Where did you get 1-α^k from?
//
// On the first probe, your odds of a collision with an existing element is α.
// The odds of doing this twice in a row is approximately α^2. For three times,
// α^3, etc. Therefore, the odds of colliding k times is α^k. The odds of NOT
// colliding after k tries is 1-α^k.
//
// The paper from 1986 cited below mentions an implementation which keeps track
// of the distance-to-initial-bucket histogram. This approach is not suitable
// for modern architectures because it requires maintaining an internal data
// structure. This allows very good first guesses, but we are most concerned
// with guessing entire cache lines, not individual indexes. Furthermore, array
// accesses are no longer linear and in one direction, as we have now. There
// is also memory and cache pressure that this would entail that would be very
// difficult to properly see in a microbenchmark.
//
// ## Future Improvements (FIXME!)
//
// Allow the load factor to be changed dynamically and/or at initialization.
//
// Also, would it be possible for us to reuse storage when growing the
// underlying table? This is exactly the use case for 'realloc', and may
// be worth exploring.
//
// ## Future Optimizations (FIXME!)
//
// Another possible design choice that I made without any real reason is
// parameterizing the raw table over keys and values. Technically, all we need
// is the size and alignment of keys and values, and the code should be just as
// efficient (well, we might need one for power-of-two size and one for not...).
// This has the potential to reduce code bloat in rust executables, without
// really losing anything except 4 words (key size, key alignment, val size,
// val alignment) which can be passed in to every call of a `RawTable` function.
// This would definitely be an avenue worth exploring if people start complaining
// about the size of rust executables.
//
// Annotate exceedingly likely branches in `table::make_hash`
// and `search_hashed` to reduce instruction cache pressure
// and mispredictions once it becomes possible (blocked on issue #11092).
//
// Shrinking the table could simply reallocate in place after moving buckets
// to the first half.
//
// The growth algorithm (fragment of the Proof of Correctness)
// --------------------
//
// The growth algorithm is basically a fast path of the naive reinsertion-
// during-resize algorithm. Other paths should never be taken.
//
// Consider growing a robin hood hashtable of capacity n. Normally, we do this
// by allocating a new table of capacity `2n`, and then individually reinsert
// each element in the old table into the new one. This guarantees that the
// new table is a valid robin hood hashtable with all the desired statistical
// properties. Remark that the order we reinsert the elements in should not
// matter. For simplicity and efficiency, we will consider only linear
// reinsertions, which consist of reinserting all elements in the old table
// into the new one by increasing order of index. However we will not be
// starting our reinsertions from index 0 in general. If we start from index
// i, for the purpose of reinsertion we will consider all elements with real
// index j < i to have virtual index n + j.
//
// Our hash generation scheme consists of generating a 64-bit hash and
// truncating the most significant bits. When moving to the new table, we
// simply introduce a new bit to the front of the hash. Therefore, if an
// elements has ideal index i in the old table, it can have one of two ideal
// locations in the new table. If the new bit is 0, then the new ideal index
// is i. If the new bit is 1, then the new ideal index is n + i. Intuitively,
// we are producing two independent tables of size n, and for each element we
// independently choose which table to insert it into with equal probability.
// However the rather than wrapping around themselves on overflowing their
// indexes, the first table overflows into the first, and the first into the
// second. Visually, our new table will look something like:
//
// [yy_xxx_xxxx_xxx|xx_yyy_yyyy_yyy]
//
// Where x's are elements inserted into the first table, y's are elements
// inserted into the second, and _'s are empty sections. We now define a few
// key concepts that we will use later. Note that this is a very abstract
// perspective of the table. A real resized table would be at least half
// empty.
//
// Theorem: A linear robin hood reinsertion from the first ideal element
// produces identical results to a linear naive reinsertion from the same
// element.
//
// FIXME(Gankro, pczarn): review the proof and put it all in a separate README.md

/// A hash map implementation which uses linear probing with Robin Hood bucket
/// stealing.
///
/// By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing algorithm selected to provide
/// resistance against HashDoS attacks. The algorithm is randomly seeded, and a
/// reasonable best-effort is made to generate this seed from a high quality,
/// secure source of randomness provided by the host without blocking the
/// program. Because of this, the randomness of the seed is dependant on the
/// quality of the system's random number generator at the time it is created.
/// In particular, seeds generated when the system's entropy pool is abnormally
/// low such as during system boot may be of a lower quality.
///
/// The default hashing algorithm is currently SipHash 1-3, though this is
/// subject to change at any point in the future. While its performance is very
/// competitive for medium sized keys, other hashing algorithms will outperform
/// it for small keys such as integers as well as large keys such as long
/// strings, though those algorithms will typically *not* protect against
/// attacks such as HashDoS.
///
/// The hashing algorithm can be replaced on a per-`HashMap` basis using the
/// `HashMap::default`, `HashMap::with_hasher`, and
/// `HashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher` methods. Many alternative algorithms
/// are available on crates.io, such as the `fnv` crate.
///
/// It is required that the keys implement the [`Eq`] and [`Hash`] traits, although
/// this can frequently be achieved by using `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`.
/// If you implement these yourself, it is important that the following
/// property holds:
///
/// ```text
/// k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
/// ```
///
/// In other words, if two keys are equal, their hashes must be equal.
///
/// It is a logic error for a key to be modified in such a way that the key's
/// hash, as determined by the [`Hash`] trait, or its equality, as determined by
/// the [`Eq`] trait, changes while it is in the map. This is normally only
/// possible through [`Cell`], [`RefCell`], global state, I/O, or unsafe code.
