//! A mostly lock-free multi-producer, single consumer queue.
//!
//! This module contains an implementation of a concurrent MPSC queue. This
//! queue can be used to share data between threads, and is also used as the
//! building block of channels in rust.
//!
//! Note that the current implementation of this queue has a caveat of the `pop`
//! method, and see the method for more information about it. Due to this
//! caveat, this queue may not be appropriate for all use-cases.
