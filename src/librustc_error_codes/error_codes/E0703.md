Invalid ABI(Application Binary Interface) used in the code.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0703
extern "invalid" fn foo() {} //~ ERROR

fn main() { }
```
At present there the few predefined ABI's (like Rust, C, system, etc.)
which we can use in our Rust code. Please verify the ABI from the
given ABI. For example you can replace the given ABI from 'Rust'.

```
extern "Rust" fn foo() {} //~ OK!

fn main() { }
```
