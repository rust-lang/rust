# The Rust Programming Language

This is a compiler for Rust, including standard libraries, tools and
documentation. Rust is a systems programming language that is fast,
memory safe and multithreaded, but does not employ a garbage collector
or otherwise impose significant runtime overhead.

To install to /usr/local (the default), run the included `install.sh` script:

    $ sudo ./install.sh

To uninstall:

    $ sudo /usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh

`install.sh` has a few options, including the possibility to set an installation
prefix. You can display these options by running:

    $ sudo ./install.sh --help

Read [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) to learn how
to use Rust.
