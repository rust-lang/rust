# $ src/ci/docker/run.sh x86_64-fuchsia

# Alternatively, from within the container with --dev, assuming you have made it
# as far as building the toolchain with the above command:
#
# $ src/ci/docker/run.sh --dev x86_64-fuchsia
# docker# git config --global --add safe.directory /checkout/obj/fuchsia
