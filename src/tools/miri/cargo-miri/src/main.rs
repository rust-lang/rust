    // Dispatch to `cargo-miri` phase. Here is a rough idea of "who calls who".
    //
    // Initially, we are invoked as `cargo-miri miri run/test`. We first run the setup phase:
    // - We use `rustc-build-sysroot`, and set `RUSTC` back to us, together with `MIRI_CALLED_FROM_SETUP`,
    //   so that the sysroot build rustc invocations end up in `phase_rustc` with `RustcPhase::Setup`.
    //   There we then call the Miri driver with `MIRI_BE_RUSTC` to perform the actual build.
    //
    // Then we call `cargo run/test`, exactly forwarding all user flags, plus some configuration so
    // that we control every binary invoked by cargo:
    // - We set RUSTC_WRAPPER to ourselves, so for (almost) all rustc invocations, we end up in
    //   `phase_rustc` with `RustcPhase::Build`. This will in turn either determine that a
    //   dependency needs to be built (for which it invokes the Miri driver with `MIRI_BE_RUSTC`),
    //   or determine that this is a binary Miri should run, in which case we generate a JSON file
    //   with all the information needed to build and run this crate.
    //   (We don't run it yet since cargo thinks this is a build step, not a run step -- running the
    //   binary here would lead to a bad user experience.)
    // - We set RUSTC to the Miri driver and also set `MIRI_BE_RUSTC`, so that gets called by build
    //   scripts (and cargo uses it for the version query).
    // - We set `target.*.runner` to `cargo-miri runner`, which ends up calling `phase_runner` for
    //   `RunnerPhase::Cargo`. This parses the JSON file written in `phase_rustc` and then invokes
    //   the actual Miri driver for interpretation.
    // - We set RUSTDOC to ourselves, which ends up in `phase_rustdoc`. There we call regular
    //   rustdoc with some extra flags, and we set `MIRI_CALLED_FROM_RUSTDOC` to recognize this
    //   phase in our recursive invocations:
    //   - We set the `--test-builder` flag of rustdoc to ourselves, which ends up in `phase_rustc`
    //     with `RustcPhase::Rustdoc`. There we perform a check-build (needed to get the expected
    //     build failures for `compile_fail` doctests) and then store a JSON file with the
    //     information needed to run this test.
    //   - We also set `--runtool` to ourselves, which ends up in `phase_runner` with
    //     `RunnerPhase::Rustdoc`. There we parse the JSON file written in `phase_rustc` and invoke
    //     the Miri driver for interpretation.
