// This is a regression test for the ICE from issue #10846.
//
// The original issue causing the ICE: the LUB-computations during
// type inference were encountering late-bound lifetimes, and
// asserting that such lifetimes should have already been substituted
// with a concrete lifetime.
//
// However, those encounters were occurring within the lexical scope
// of the binding for the late-bound lifetime; that is, the late-bound
// lifetimes were perfectly valid. The core problem was that the type
// folding code was over-zealously passing back all lifetimes when
// doing region-folding, when really all clients of the region-folding
// case only want to see *free* lifetime variables, not bound ones.
