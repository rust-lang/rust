warning: sharing memory with a native function called via FFI

   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ sharing memory with a native function
   |
   = help: when memory is shared with a native function call, Miri stops tracking initialization and provenance for that memory
   = help: in particular, Miri assumes that the native call initializes all memory it has access to
   = help: Miri also assumes that any part of this memory may be a pointer that is permitted to point to arbitrary exposed memory
   = help: what this means is that Miri will easily miss Undefined Behavior related to incorrect usage of this shared memory, so you should not take a clean Miri run as a signal that your FFI code is UB-free
