   = help: this indicates a bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, and caused Undefined Behavior
   = help: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html for further information
   = help: this means these two types are not *guaranteed* to be ABI-compatible across all targets
   = help: if you think this code should be accepted anyway, please report an issue with Miri
   = note: this error occurred while pushing a call frame onto an empty stack
   = note: the span indicates which code caused the function to be called, but may not be the literal call site
   = note: this error originates in the macro `ctor` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
