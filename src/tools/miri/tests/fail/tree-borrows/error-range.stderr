   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is a child of the conflicting tag <TAG>
   = help: the conflicting tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids child read accesses
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x5..0x6]
