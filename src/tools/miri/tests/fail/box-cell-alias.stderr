error: Undefined Behavior: trying to retag from <TAG> for SharedReadWrite permission at ALLOC[0x0], but that tag does not exist in the borrow stack for this location

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Stacked Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
