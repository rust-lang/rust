error: unsupported operation: Miri can only use intrinsic fallback bodies that exactly reflect the specification: they fully check for UB and are as non-deterministic as possible. After verifying that `ptr_guaranteed_cmp` does so, add the `#[miri::intrinsic_fallback_is_spec]` attribute to it; also ping @rust-lang/miri when you do that
