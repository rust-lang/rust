error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> (root of the allocation) at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> (root of the allocation) at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> (root of the allocation) is foreign to the protected tag <TAG> (i.e., it is not a child)
   = help: this foreign write access would cause the protected tag <TAG> (currently Active) to become Disabled
   = help: protected tags must never be Disabled
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

   = note: this error originates in the macro `::core::intrinsics::mir::__internal_remove_let` which comes from the expansion of the macro `mir` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace
