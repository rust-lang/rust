   = note: this error originates in the macro `::core::intrinsics::mir::__internal_remove_let` which comes from the expansion of the macro `mir` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace
