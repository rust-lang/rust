error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[OFFSET] is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a reborrow (acting as a foreign read access) at offsets [OFFSET]
