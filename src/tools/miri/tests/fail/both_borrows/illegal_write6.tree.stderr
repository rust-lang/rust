error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden
  --> tests/fail/both_borrows/illegal_write6.rs:LL:CC

LL |     unsafe { *y = 2 };
   |              ^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is foreign to the protected tag <TAG> (i.e., it is not a child)
   = help: this foreign write access would cause the protected tag <TAG> (currently Active) to become Disabled
   = help: protected tags must never be Disabled
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

LL |     let x = &mut 0u32;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^
help: the protected tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

help: the protected tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

LL |     *a = 1;
   |     ^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
