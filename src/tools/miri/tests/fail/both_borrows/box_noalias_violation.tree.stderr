error: Undefined Behavior: read access through <TAG> is forbidden

   |     ^^ read access through <TAG> is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is foreign to the protected tag <TAG> (i.e., it is not a child)
   = help: this foreign read access would cause the protected tag <TAG> to transition from Active to Frozen
   = help: this transition would be a loss of write permissions, which is not allowed for protected tags
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

LL |         let ptr = &mut v as *mut i32;
   |                   ^^^^^^
help: the protected tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL | unsafe fn test(mut x: Box<i32>, y: *const i32) -> i32 {
   |                ^^^^^
help: the protected tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
