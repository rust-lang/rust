error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden
  --> tests/fail/both_borrows/illegal_read_despite_exposed2.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         *root2 = 3;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |         let root2 = &mut *exposed_ptr;
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Unique due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> tests/fail/both_borrows/illegal_read_despite_exposed2.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         *root2 = 42;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> tests/fail/both_borrows/illegal_read_despite_exposed2.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         let _val = *exposed_ptr;
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
