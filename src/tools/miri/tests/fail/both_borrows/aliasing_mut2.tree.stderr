error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

LL |     *y = 2;
   |     ^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Reserved (conflicted) which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL | pub fn safe(x: &i32, y: &mut i32) {
   |                      ^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Reserved (conflicted) due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

   = help: this transition corresponds to a temporary loss of write permissions until function exit
