error: Undefined Behavior: read access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

LL |     let _val = *xref;
   |                ^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this child read access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let xref = unsafe { &mut *xraw };
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

LL |     unsafe { *xraw = 15 };
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read and write permissions
