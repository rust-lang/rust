error: Undefined Behavior: reborrow through <TAG> is forbidden
  --> $DIR/pass_invalid_shr.rs:LL:CC

LL |     foo(xref);
   |         ^^^^ reborrow through <TAG> is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this reborrow (acting as a child read access)
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Frozen

LL |     let xref = unsafe { &*xraw };
   |                         ^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> $DIR/pass_invalid_shr.rs:LL:CC

LL |     unsafe { *xraw = 42 }; // unfreeze
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read permissions
