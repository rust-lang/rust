error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x4] is forbidden

LL |     v2[1] = 7;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let v2 = safe::as_mut_slice(&v);
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x4..0x8]

LL |     v1[1] = 5;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read and write permissions
