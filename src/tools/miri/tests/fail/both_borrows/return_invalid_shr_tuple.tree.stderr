error: Undefined Behavior: reborrow through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x4] is forbidden

LL |     ret
   |     ^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this reborrow (acting as a child read access)
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Frozen

LL |     let ret = (unsafe { &(*xraw).1 },);
   |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x8]

   |
LL |     unsafe { *xraw = (42, 23) }; // unfreeze
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read permissions
