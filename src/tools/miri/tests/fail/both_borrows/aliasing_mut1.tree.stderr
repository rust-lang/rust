   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL | pub fn safe(x: &mut i32, y: &mut i32) {
   |             ^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a reborrow (acting as a foreign read access) at offsets [0x0..0x4]
