   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is foreign to the protected tag <TAG> (i.e., it is not a child)
   = help: this foreign write access would cause the protected tag <TAG> to transition from Frozen to Disabled
   = help: this transition would be a loss of read permissions, which is not allowed for protected tags
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here
