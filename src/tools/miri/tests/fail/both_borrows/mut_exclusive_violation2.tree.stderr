   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |         let raw1 = ptr1.as_mut();
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read and write permissions
