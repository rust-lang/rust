error: Undefined Behavior: deallocation through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is foreign to the protected tag <TAG> (i.e., it is not a child)
   = help: this deallocation (acting as a foreign write access) would cause the protected tag <TAG> (currently Reserved (conflicted)) to become Disabled
   = help: protected tags must never be Disabled
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

help: the protected tag <TAG> later transitioned to Reserved (conflicted) due to a reborrow (acting as a foreign read access) at offsets [0x0..0x4]
