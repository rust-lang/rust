error: Undefined Behavior: trying to retag from <TAG> for SharedReadWrite permission at ALLOC[0x0], but that tag does not exist in the borrow stack for this location

LL |         let _val = *inner_shr.get();
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^ this error occurs as part of retag at ALLOC[0x0..0x4]

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Stacked Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
help: <TAG> was created by a SharedReadWrite retag at offsets [0x0..0x4]

LL |         let inner_shr = &*inner_uniq; // adds a SharedReadWrite

help: <TAG> was later invalidated at offsets [0x0..0x4] by a write access

LL |         *c.get() = UnsafeCell::new(1); // invalidates inner_shr
