error: Undefined Behavior: attempting a read access using <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0], but that tag does not exist in the borrow stack for this location

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Stacked Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
help: <TAG> was created by a SharedReadOnly retag at offsets [0x0..0x4]
