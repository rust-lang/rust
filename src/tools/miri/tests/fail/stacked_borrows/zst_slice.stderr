error: Undefined Behavior: trying to retag from <TAG> for SharedReadOnly permission at ALLOC[0x4], but that tag does not exist in the borrow stack for this location
  --> tests/fail/stacked_borrows/zst_slice.rs:LL:CC

LL |         assert_eq!(*s.as_ptr().add(1), 2);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this error occurs as part of retag at ALLOC[0x4..0x8]

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Stacked Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
help: <TAG> would have been created here, but this is a zero-size retag ([0x0..0x0]) so the tag in question does not exist anywhere
