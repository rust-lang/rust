error: Miri can only run programs that have a main function.
       Alternatively, you can export a `miri_start` function:
       
       #[cfg(miri)]
       #[no_mangle]
       fn miri_start(argc: isize, argv: *const *const u8) -> isize {
           // Call the actual start function that your project implements, based on your target's conventions.
       }
