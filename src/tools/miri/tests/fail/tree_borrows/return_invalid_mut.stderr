error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> is forbidden
  --> $DIR/return_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     *ret = 3;
   |     ^^^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is a child of the conflicting tag <TAG>
   = help: the conflicting tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here
  --> $DIR/return_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     let ret = foo(arg);
   |               ^^^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved
  --> $DIR/return_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     let ret = unsafe { &mut (*xraw).1 };
   |                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x4..0x8]
  --> $DIR/return_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     *ret = *ret; // activate
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x8]
  --> $DIR/return_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     let _val = unsafe { *xraw }; // invalidate xref for writing
   |                         ^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
