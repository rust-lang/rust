error: Undefined Behavior: read access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

LL |     let _fail = *reb3;
   |                 ^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this child read access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let reb3 = unsafe { &mut *wild };
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/wildcard/cross_tree_from_main.rs:LL:CC

LL |     *ref2 = 13;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read and write permissions
