error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <wildcard> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/wildcard/multi_exposed_siblings_local.rs:LL:CC

LL |     unsafe { wild.write(0) };
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <wildcard> is a child of the conflicting tag <TAG>
   = help: the conflicting tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let ptr_base = &mut x as *mut u32;
   |                    ^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Unique due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]

LL |     unsafe { wild.write(41) };
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/wildcard/multi_exposed_siblings_local.rs:LL:CC

LL |     let _y = x;
   |              ^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
