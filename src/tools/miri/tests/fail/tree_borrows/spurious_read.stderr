error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Reserved (conflicted) which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Reserved (conflicted) due to a protector release (acting as a foreign read access) on every location previously accessed by this tag
