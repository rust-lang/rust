error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> is forbidden
  --> $DIR/parent_read_freezes_raw_mut.rs:LL:CC

LL |         *ptr = 0;
   |         ^^^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |         let mref = &mut root;
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x1]
  --> $DIR/parent_read_freezes_raw_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         *ptr = 0; // Write
   |         ^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a reborrow (acting as a foreign read access) at offsets [0x0..0x1]

LL |         assert_eq!(root, 0); // Parent Read
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions

   = note: inside `main` at $DIR/parent_read_freezes_raw_mut.rs:LL:CC
   = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_eq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace
