error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/parent_read_freezes_raw_mut.rs:LL:CC

LL |         *ptr = 0;
   |         ^^^^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |         let mref = &mut root;
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x1]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/parent_read_freezes_raw_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         *ptr = 0; // Write
   |         ^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a reborrow (acting as a foreign read access) at offsets [0x0..0x1]

LL |         assert_eq!(root, 0); // Parent Read
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
   = note: BACKTRACE (of the first span):
   = note: inside `main` at tests/fail/tree_borrows/parent_read_freezes_raw_mut.rs:LL:CC
   = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_eq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace
