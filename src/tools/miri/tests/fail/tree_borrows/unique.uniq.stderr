error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

LL |         *uniq.as_ptr() = 2;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is a child of the conflicting tag <TAG>
   = help: the conflicting tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

LL |         *uniq.as_ptr() = 2;
   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |         let uniq = Unique::new_unchecked(rawptr);
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x1]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/unique.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         *uniq.as_ptr() = 1; // activation
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x1]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/unique.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         let _maybe_parent = *rawptr; // maybe becomes Frozen
   |                             ^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
