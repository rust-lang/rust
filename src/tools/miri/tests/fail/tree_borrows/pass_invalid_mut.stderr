error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

LL |     *nope = 31;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^ Undefined Behavior occurred here
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/tree-borrows.md for further information
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is a child of the conflicting tag <TAG>
   = help: the conflicting tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/pass_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC

LL | fn foo(nope: &mut i32) {
   |        ^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

   |
LL |     let xref = unsafe { &mut *xraw };
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/pass_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     *xref = 18; // activate xref
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x4]
  --> tests/fail/tree_borrows/pass_invalid_mut.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |     let _val = unsafe { *xraw }; // invalidate xref for writing
   |                         ^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
