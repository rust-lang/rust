error: Undefined Behavior: write access through <TAG> is forbidden
  --> $DIR/unique.rs:LL:CC

LL |         *uniq.as_ptr() = 3;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> is forbidden
   |
   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Frozen which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let refmut = &mut data;
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Active due to a child write access at offsets [0x0..0x1]
  --> $DIR/unique.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL |         *uniq.as_ptr() = 1; // activation
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to the first write to a 2-phase borrowed mutable reference
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Frozen due to a foreign read access at offsets [0x0..0x1]
  --> $DIR/unique.rs:LL:CC

LL |         let _definitely_parent = data; // definitely Frozen by now
   |                                  ^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of write permissions
