   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ write access through <TAG> at ALLOC[0x0] is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this child write access
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

LL |     let child2 = x.as_ptr();
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^
help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x1]

LL |     child1.write(1);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read and write permissions
