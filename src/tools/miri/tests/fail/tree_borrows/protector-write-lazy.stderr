   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this reborrow (acting as a child read access)
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Reserved

help: the accessed tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a protector release (acting as a foreign write access) on every location previously accessed by this tag

   = note: BACKTRACE (of the first span):
   = note: inside `main` at tests/fail/tree_borrows/protector-write-lazy.rs:LL:CC
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace
