//! This module defines the `Assist` data structure. The actual assist live in
//! the `ide_assists` downstream crate. We want to define the data structures in
//! this low-level crate though, because `ide_diagnostics` also need them
//! (fixits for diagnostics and assists are the same thing under the hood). We
//! want to compile `ide_assists` and `ide_diagnostics` in parallel though, so
//! we pull the common definitions upstream, to this crate.
