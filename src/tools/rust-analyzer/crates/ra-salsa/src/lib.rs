/// This type is meant to be used to help give meaningful error messages to the
/// user or to help salsa developers figure out why their program is resulting
/// in a computation cycle.
///
/// It is used in a few ways:
///
/// * During [cycle recovery](https://https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/cycles/fallback.html),
///   where it is given to the fallback function.
/// * As the panic value when an unexpected cycle (i.e., a cycle where one or more participants
///   lacks cycle recovery information) occurs.
///
/// You can read more about cycle handling in
/// the [salsa book](https://https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/cycles.html).
