/// The actual algorithm for expansion is not too hard, but is pretty tricky.
/// `Bindings` structure is the key to understanding what we are doing here.
///
/// On the high level, it stores mapping from meta variables to the bits of
/// syntax it should be substituted with. For example, if `$e:expr` is matched
/// with `1 + 1` by macro_rules, the `Binding` will store `$e -> 1 + 1`.
///
/// The tricky bit is dealing with repetitions (`$()*`). Consider this example:
///
/// ```not_rust
/// macro_rules! foo {
///     ($($ i:ident $($ e:expr),*);*) => {
///         $(fn $ i() { $($ e);*; })*
///     }
/// }
/// foo! { foo 1,2,3; bar 4,5,6 }
/// ```
///
/// Here, the `$i` meta variable is matched first with `foo` and then with
/// `bar`, and `$e` is matched in turn with `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`.
///
/// To represent such "multi-mappings", we use a recursive structures: we map
/// variables not to values, but to *lists* of values or other lists (that is,
/// to the trees).
///
/// For the above example, the bindings would store
///
/// ```not_rust
/// i -> [foo, bar]
/// e -> [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
/// ```
///
/// We construct `Bindings` in the `match_lhs`. The interesting case is
/// `TokenTree::Repeat`, where we use `push_nested` to create the desired
/// nesting structure.
///
/// The other side of the puzzle is `expand_subtree`, where we use the bindings
/// to substitute meta variables in the output template. When expanding, we
/// maintain a `nesting` stack of indices which tells us which occurrence from
/// the `Bindings` we should take. We push to the stack when we enter a
/// repetition.
///
/// In other words, `Bindings` is a *multi* mapping from `Symbol` to
/// `tt::TokenTree`, where the index to select a particular `TokenTree` among
/// many is not a plain `usize`, but a `&[usize]`.
