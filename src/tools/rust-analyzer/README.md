rust-analyzer is a language server that provides IDE functionality for
writing Rust programs. You can use it with any editor that supports
the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (VS
Code, Vim, Emacs, Zed, etc).

rust-analyzer features include go-to-definition, find-all-references,
refactorings and code completion. rust-analyzer also supports
integrated formatting (with rustfmt) and integrated diagnostics (with
rustc and clippy).

Internally, rust-analyzer is structured as a set of libraries for
analyzing Rust code. See
[Architecture](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/contributing/architecture.html)
in the manual.
