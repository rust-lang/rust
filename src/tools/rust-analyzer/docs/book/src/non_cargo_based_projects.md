# Non-Cargo Based Projects

rust-analyzer does not require Cargo. However, if you use some other
build system, you’ll have to describe the structure of your project for
rust-analyzer in the `rust-project.json` format:

```typescript
interface JsonProject {
    /// Path to the sysroot directory.
    ///
    /// The sysroot is where rustc looks for the
    /// crates that are built-in to rust, such as
    /// std.
    ///
    /// https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html#--sysroot-override-the-system-root
    ///
    /// To see the current value of sysroot, you
    /// can query rustc:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// $ rustc --print sysroot
    /// /Users/yourname/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-apple-darwin
    /// ```
    sysroot?: string;
    /// Path to the directory with *source code* of
    /// sysroot crates.
    ///
    /// By default, this is `lib/rustlib/src/rust/library`
    /// relative to the sysroot.
    ///
    /// It should point to the directory where std,
    /// core, and friends can be found:
    ///
    /// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library.
    ///
    /// If provided, rust-analyzer automatically adds
    /// dependencies on sysroot crates. Conversely,
    /// if you omit this path, you can specify sysroot
    /// dependencies yourself and, for example, have
    /// several different "sysroots" in one graph of
    /// crates.
    sysroot_src?: string;
    /// List of groups of common cfg values, to allow
    /// sharing them between crates.
    ///
    /// Maps from group name to its cfgs. Cfg follow
    /// the same format as `Crate.cfg`.
    cfg_groups?: { [key: string]: string[]; };
    /// The set of crates comprising the current
    /// project. Must include all transitive
    /// dependencies as well as sysroot crate (libstd,
    /// libcore and such).
    crates: Crate[];
    /// Configuration for CLI commands.
    ///
    /// These are used for running and debugging binaries
    /// and tests without encoding build system-specific
    /// knowledge into rust-analyzer.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// Below is an example of a test runnable. `{label}` and `{test_id}`
    /// are explained in `Runnable::args`'s documentation below.
    ///
    /// ```json
    /// {
    ///     "program": "buck",
    ///     "args": [
    ///         "test",
    ///          "{label}",
    ///          "--",
    ///          "{test_id}",
    ///          "--print-passing-details"
    ///     ],
    ///     "cwd": "/home/user/repo-root/",

    runnables?: Runnable[];
}

    };

    /// CodeLens above a test.
    ///
    /// The args for testOne can contain two template strings:
    /// `{label}` and `{test_id}`. `{label}` will be replaced
    /// with the `Build::label` and `{test_id}` will be replaced
    /// with the test name.
    kind: 'testOne' | string;
}
```

This format is provisional and subject to change. Specifically, the
`roots` setup will be different eventually.

There are three ways to feed `rust-project.json` to rust-analyzer:

-   Place `rust-project.json` file at the root of the project, and
    rust-analyzer will discover it.

-   Specify
    `"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [ "path/to/rust-project.json" ]` in
    the settings (and make sure that your LSP client sends settings as a
    part of initialize request).

-   Specify
    `"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [ { "roots": […​], "crates": […​] }]`
    inline.

Relative paths are interpreted relative to `rust-project.json` file
location or (for inline JSON) relative to `rootUri`.

You can set the `RA_LOG` environment variable to `rust_analyzer=info` to
inspect how rust-analyzer handles config and project loading.

Note that calls to `cargo check` are disabled when using
`rust-project.json` by default, so compilation errors and warnings will
no longer be sent to your LSP client. To enable these compilation errors
you will need to specify explicitly what command rust-analyzer should
run to perform the checks using the
`rust-analyzer.check.overrideCommand` configuration. As an example, the
following configuration explicitly sets `cargo check` as the `check`
command.

    { "rust-analyzer.check.overrideCommand": ["cargo", "check", "--message-format=json"] }

`check.overrideCommand` requires the command specified to output json
error messages for rust-analyzer to consume. The `--message-format=json`
flag does this for `cargo check` so whichever command you use must also
output errors in this format. See the [Configuration](#_configuration)
section for more information.
