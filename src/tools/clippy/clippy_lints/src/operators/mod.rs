    /// ### What it does
    /// Checks for (in-)equality comparisons on constant floating-point
    /// values (apart from zero), except in functions called `*eq*` (which probably
    /// implement equality for a type involving floats).
    ///
    /// ### Why restrict this?
    /// Floating point calculations are usually imprecise, so asking if two values are *exactly*
    /// equal is asking for trouble because arriving at the same logical result via different
    /// routes (e.g. calculation versus constant) may yield different values.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```no_run
    /// let a: f64 = 1000.1;
    /// let b: f64 = 0.2;
    /// let x = a + b;
    /// const Y: f64 = 1000.3; // Expected value.
    ///
    /// // Actual value: 1000.3000000000001
    /// println!("{x}");
    ///
    /// let are_equal = x == Y;
    /// println!("{are_equal}"); // false
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The correct way to compare floating point numbers is to define an allowed error margin. This
    /// may be challenging if there is no "natural" error margin to permit. Broadly speaking, there
    /// are two cases:
    ///
    /// 1. If your values are in a known range and you can define a threshold for "close enough to
    ///    be equal", it may be appropriate to define an absolute error margin. For example, if your
    ///    data is "length of vehicle in centimeters", you may consider 0.1 cm to be "close enough".
    /// 1. If your code is more general and you do not know the range of values, you should use a
    ///    relative error margin, accepting e.g. 0.1% of error regardless of specific values.
    ///
    /// For the scenario where you can define a meaningful absolute error margin, consider using:
    ///
    /// ```no_run
    /// let a: f64 = 1000.1;
    /// let b: f64 = 0.2;
    /// let x = a + b;
    /// const Y: f64 = 1000.3; // Expected value.
    ///
    /// const ALLOWED_ERROR_VEHICLE_LENGTH_CM: f64 = 0.1;
    /// let within_tolerance = (x - Y).abs() < ALLOWED_ERROR_VEHICLE_LENGTH_CM;
    /// println!("{within_tolerance}"); // true
    /// ```
    ///
    /// NB! Do not use `f64::EPSILON` - while the error margin is often called "epsilon", this is
    /// a different use of the term that is not suitable for floating point equality comparison.
    /// Indeed, for the example above using `f64::EPSILON` as the allowed error would return `false`.
    ///
    /// For the scenario where no meaningful absolute error can be defined, refer to
    /// [the floating point guide](https://www.floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison)
    /// for a reference implementation of relative error based comparison of floating point values.
    /// `MIN_NORMAL` in the reference implementation is equivalent to `MIN_POSITIVE` in Rust.
