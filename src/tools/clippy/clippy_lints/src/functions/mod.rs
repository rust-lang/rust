    /// Checks for public functions that dereference raw pointer
    /// arguments but are not marked `unsafe`.
    ///
    /// ### Why is this bad?
    /// The function should almost definitely be marked `unsafe`, since for an
    /// arbitrary raw pointer, there is no way of telling for sure if it is valid.
    ///
    /// In general, this lint should **never be disabled** unless it is definitely a
    /// false positive (please submit an issue if so) since it breaks Rust's
    /// soundness guarantees, directly exposing API users to potentially dangerous
    /// program behavior. This is also true for internal APIs, as it is easy to leak
    /// unsoundness.
    ///
    /// ### Context
    /// In Rust, an `unsafe {...}` block is used to indicate that the code in that
    /// section has been verified in some way that the compiler can not. For a
    /// function that accepts a raw pointer then accesses the pointer's data, this is
    /// generally impossible as the incoming pointer could point anywhere, valid or
    /// not. So, the signature should be marked `unsafe fn`: this indicates that the
    /// function's caller must provide some verification that the arguments it sends
    /// are valid (and then call the function within an `unsafe` block).
    ///
    /// ### Known problems
    /// * It does not check functions recursively so if the pointer is passed to a
    /// private non-`unsafe` function which does the dereferencing, the lint won't
    /// trigger (false negative).
    /// * It only checks for arguments whose type are raw pointers, not raw pointers
    /// got from an argument in some other way (`fn foo(bar: &[*const u8])` or
    /// `some_argument.get_raw_ptr()`) (false negative).
    ///
    /// ### Example
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// pub fn foo(x: *const u8) {
    ///     println!("{}", unsafe { *x });
    /// }
    ///
    /// // this call "looks" safe but will segfault or worse!
    /// // foo(invalid_ptr);

    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// pub unsafe fn foo(x: *const u8) {
    ///     println!("{}", unsafe { *x });
    /// }
    ///
    /// // this would cause a compiler error for calling without `unsafe`
    /// // foo(invalid_ptr);
    ///
    /// // sound call if the caller knows the pointer is valid
