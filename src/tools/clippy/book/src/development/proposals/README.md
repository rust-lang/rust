# Proposals

This chapter is about accepted proposals for changes that should be worked on in
or around Clippy in the long run.

Besides adding more and more lints and improve the lints that Clippy already
has, Clippy is also interested in making the experience of its users, developers
and maintainers better over time. Projects that address bigger picture things
like this usually take more time, and it is useful to have a proposal for those
first. This is the place where such proposals are collected, so that we can
refer to them when working on them.
