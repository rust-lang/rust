# `clippy-utils`

Helpful tools for writing lints, provided as they are used in Clippy.

## Usage

This crate is only guaranteed to build with this `nightly` toolchain:

<!-- begin autogenerated nightly -->
```
nightly-2025-05-21
```
<!-- end autogenerated nightly -->

To use `clippy-utils` in your lint, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
clippy_utils = "0.1.XY"
```

`XY` is the version of the nightly toolchain above and can be determined with `rustc +nightly-YYYY-MM-DD -V`.
