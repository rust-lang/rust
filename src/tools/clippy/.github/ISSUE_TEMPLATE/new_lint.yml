        What makes this lint different from any existing lints that are similar, and how are those differences useful?

        You can [use this playground template to see what existing lints are triggered by the bad code][playground]
        (make sure to use "Tools > Clippy" and not "Build").
        You can also look through the list of [rustc's allowed-by-default lints][allowed-by-default],
        as those won't show up in the playground above.

        [allowed-by-default]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/allowed-by-default.html
