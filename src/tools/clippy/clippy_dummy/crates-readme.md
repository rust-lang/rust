Installing Clippy via crates.io is deprecated. Please use the following:

```terminal
rustup component add clippy
```

on a Rust version 1.29 or later. You may need to run `rustup self update` if it complains about a missing Clippy binary.

See [the homepage](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/#clippy) for more information
