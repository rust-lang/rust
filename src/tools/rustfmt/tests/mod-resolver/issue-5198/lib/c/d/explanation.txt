This file is contained in the './lib/c/d/' directory.

The directory name './lib/c/d/' conflicts with the './lib/c/d.rs' file name.

'./lib/c/d.rs' defines 3 external modules:

    * mod e;
    * mod f;
    * mod g;

Module resolution will fail if we look for './lib/c/d/e.rs' or './lib/c/d/e/mod.rs',
so we should fall back to looking for './lib/c/e.rs', which correctly finds the module, that
rustfmt should format.

'./lib/c/d/f.rs' and './lib/c/d/g/mod.rs' exist at the default submodule paths so we should be able
to resolve these modules with no problems.
