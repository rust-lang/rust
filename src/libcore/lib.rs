//! # The Rust Core Library
//!
//! The Rust Core Library is the dependency-free foundation of [The
//! Rust Standard Library](../std/index.html). It is the portable glue
//! between the language and its libraries, defining the intrinsic and
//! primitive building blocks of all Rust code. It links to no
//! upstream libraries, no system libraries, and no libc.
//!
//! The core library is *minimal*: it isn't even aware of heap allocation,
//! nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require
//! platform integration, and this library is platform-agnostic.
//!
//! *It is not recommended to use the core library*. The stable
//! functionality of libcore is reexported from the
//! [standard library](../std/index.html). The composition of this library is
//! subject to change over time; only the interface exposed through libstd is
//! intended to be stable.
//!
//! # How to use the core library
//!
// FIXME: Fill me in with more detail when the interface settles
//! This library is built on the assumption of a few existing symbols:
//!
//! * `memcpy`, `memcmp`, `memset` - These are core memory routines which are
//!   often generated by LLVM. Additionally, this library can make explicit
//!   calls to these functions. Their signatures are the same as found in C.
//!   These functions are often provided by the system libc, but can also be
//!   provided by `librlibc` which is distributed with the standard rust
//!   distribution.
//!
//! * `rust_begin_unwind` - This function takes three arguments, a
//!   `fmt::Arguments`, a `&str`, and a `uint`. These three arguments dictate
//!   the panic message, the file at which panic was invoked, and the line.
//!   It is up to consumers of this core library to define this panic
//!   function; it is only required to never return.

// Since libcore defines many fundamental lang items, all tests live in a
// separate crate, libcoretest, to avoid bizarre issues.
