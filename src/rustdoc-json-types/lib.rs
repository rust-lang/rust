//! Rustdoc's JSON output interface
//!
//! These types are the public API exposed through the `--output-format json` flag. The [`Crate`]
//! struct is the root of the JSON blob and all other items are contained within.
//!
//! We expose a `rustc-hash` feature that is disabled by default. This feature switches the
//! [`std::collections::HashMap`] for [`rustc_hash::FxHashMap`] to improve the performance of said
//! `HashMap` in specific situations.
//!
//! `cargo-semver-checks` for example, saw a [-3% improvement][1] when benchmarking using the
//! `aws_sdk_ec2` JSON output (~500MB of JSON). As always, we recommend measuring the impact before
//! turning this feature on, as [`FxHashMap`][2] only concerns itself with hash speed, and may
//! increase the number of collisions.
//!
