% The Rust Programming Language Book

Welcome! This book will teach you about the [Rust Programming Language][rust].
Rust is a systems programming language that's focused on three goals: safety, speed,
and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector,
which makes it ideal for a number of use cases that other languages aren’t
suited for: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time
requirements, and low-level code like device drivers and operating systems. A 
major advantage that Rust has over other programming languages are the built in
safety features that don't impact performance.  The language, and the compiler 
are designed to work together providing comprehensive compile-time safety checks
that produce no runtime overhead, and eliminates common bugs like data races.  Rust
also provides many ‘zero-cost abstractions’ giving it the look and feel of a 
high-level language, while maintaining the precise control of a low-level language.  
Rust is versatile enough to build everything from game engines to RESTful web services.  
By reading this book, and learning Rust, you will be able to develop higher quality software 
that you can count on.

“The Rust Programming Language Book” is split into eight sections including this introduction.
Table of contents:

* [Getting started][gs] - Set up your computer for Rust development.
* [Learn Rust][lr] - Learn Rust programming through small projects.
* [Effective Rust][er] - Higher-level concepts for writing excellent Rust code.
* [Syntax and Semantics][ss] - Each bit of Rust, broken down into small chunks.
* [Nightly Rust][nr] - Cutting-edge features that aren’t in stable builds yet.
* [Glossary][gl] - A reference of terms used in the book.
* [Bibliography][bi] - Background on Rust's influences, papers about Rust.

After reading this introduction, you’ll want to dive into either ‘Learn Rust’ or
‘Syntax and Semantics’, depending on your preference: ‘Learn Rust’ if you want
to dive in with a project, or ‘Syntax and Semantics’ if you prefer to start
small, and learn a single concept thoroughly before moving onto the next.
Copious cross-linking connects these parts together.
