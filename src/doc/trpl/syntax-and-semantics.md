% Syntax and Semantics

This section breaks Rust down into small chunks, one for each concept.

If you’d like to learn Rust from the bottom up, reading this in order is a
great way to do that.

These sections also form a reference for each concept, so if you’re reading
another tutorial and find something confusing, you can find it explained
somewhere in here.
