% Basics

This section is a linear introduction to the basic syntax and semantics of
Rust. It has individual sections on each part of Rust's syntax, and cumulates
in a small project: a guessing game.

After reading "Basics," you will have a good foundation to learn more about
Rust, and can write very simple programs.
