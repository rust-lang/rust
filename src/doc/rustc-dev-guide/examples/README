For each example to compile, you will need to first run the following:

    rustup component add rustc-dev llvm-tools

To create an executable:

    rustup run nightly rustc rustc-driver-example.rs

You might need to be more specific about the exact nightly version. See the comments at the top of
the examples for the version they were written for.

To run an executable:

    rustup run nightly ./rustc-driver-example
