# Move paths

<!-- toc -->

In reality, it's not enough to track initialization at the granularity
of local variables. Rust also allows us to do moves and initialization
at the field granularity:

```rust,ignore
fn foo() {
    let a: (Vec<u32>, Vec<u32>) = (vec![22], vec![44]);

    // a.0 and a.1 are both initialized

    let b = a.0; // moves a.0

    // a.0 is not initialized, but a.1 still is

    let c = a.0; // ERROR
    let d = a.1; // OK
}
```

To handle this, we track initialization at the granularity of a **move
path**. A [`MovePath`] represents some location that the user can
initialize, move, etc. So e.g. there is a move-path representing the
local variable `a`, and there is a move-path representing `a.0`.  Move
paths roughly correspond to the concept of a [`Place`] from MIR, but
they are indexed in ways that enable us to do move analysis more
efficiently.

## Move path indices

Although there is a [`MovePath`] data structure, they are never referenced
directly.  Instead, all the code passes around *indices* of type
[`MovePathIndex`]. If you need to get information about a move path, you use
this index with the [`move_paths` field of the `MoveData`][move_paths]. For
example, to convert a [`MovePathIndex`] `mpi` into a MIR [`Place`], you might
access the [`MovePath::place`] field like so:

```rust,ignore
move_data.move_paths[mpi].place
```

## Building move paths

One of the first things we do in the MIR borrow check is to construct
the set of move paths. This is done as part of the
[`MoveData::gather_moves`] function. This function uses a MIR visitor
called [`MoveDataBuilder`] to walk the MIR and look at how each [`Place`]
within is accessed. For each such [`Place`], it constructs a
corresponding [`MovePathIndex`]. It also records when/where that
particular move path is moved/initialized, but we'll get to that in a
later section.

### Illegal move paths

We don't actually create a move-path for **every** [`Place`] that gets
used.  In particular, if it is illegal to move from a [`Place`], then
there is no need for a [`MovePathIndex`]. Some examples:

- You cannot move from a static variable, so we do not create a [`MovePathIndex`]
  for static variables.
- You cannot move an individual element of an array, so if we have e.g. `foo: [String; 3]`,
  there would be no move-path for `foo[1]`.
- You cannot move from inside of a borrowed reference, so if we have e.g. `foo: &String`,
  there would be no move-path for `*foo`.

These rules are enforced by the [`move_path_for`] function, which
converts a [`Place`] into a [`MovePathIndex`] -- in error cases like
those just discussed, the function returns an `Err`. This in turn
means we don't have to bother tracking whether those places are
initialized (which lowers overhead).

## Looking up a move-path

If you have a [`Place`] and you would like to convert it to a [`MovePathIndex`], you
can do that using the [`MovePathLookup`] structure found in the [`rev_lookup`] field
of [`MoveData`]. There are two different methods:

[`MoveData`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html
[`MovePathLookup`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html
[`rev_lookup`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#structfield.rev_lookup

- [`find_local`], which takes a [`mir::Local`] representing a local
  variable. This is the easier method, because we **always** create a
  [`MovePathIndex`] for every local variable.
- [`find`], which takes an arbitrary [`Place`]. This method is a bit
  more annoying to use, precisely because we don't have a
  [`MovePathIndex`] for **every** [`Place`] (as we just discussed in
  the "illegal move paths" section). Therefore, [`find`] returns a
  [`LookupResult`] indicating the closest path it was able to find
  that exists (e.g., for `foo[1]`, it might return just the path for
  `foo`).

## Cross-references

As we noted above, move-paths are stored in a big vector and
referenced via their [`MovePathIndex`]. However, within this vector,
they are also structured into a tree. So for example if you have the
[`MovePathIndex`] for `a.b.c`, you can go to its parent move-path
`a.b`. You can also iterate over all children paths: so, from `a.b`,
you might iterate to find the path `a.b.c` (here you are iterating
just over the paths that are **actually referenced** in the source,
not all **possible** paths that could have been referenced). These
references are used for example in the
[`find_in_move_path_or_its_descendants`] function, which determines
whether a move-path (e.g., `a.b`) or any child of that move-path
(e.g.,`a.b.c`) matches a given predicate.
