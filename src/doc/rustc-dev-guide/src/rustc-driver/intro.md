# `rustc_driver` and `rustc_interface`

## `rustc_driver`

The [`rustc_driver`] is essentially `rustc`'s `main` function.
It acts as the glue for running the various phases of the compiler in the correct order,
using the interface defined in the [`rustc_interface`] crate. Where possible, using [`rustc_driver`] rather than [`rustc_interface`] is recommended.

The main entry point of [`rustc_driver`] is [`rustc_driver::RunCompiler`][rd_rc].
This builder accepts the same command-line args as rustc as well as an implementation of [`Callbacks`][cb] and a couple of other optional options.
[`Callbacks`][cb] is a `trait` that allows for custom compiler configuration,
as well as allowing custom code to run after different phases of the compilation.

## `rustc_interface`

The [`rustc_interface`] crate provides a low level API to external users for manually driving the compilation process,
allowing third parties to effectively use `rustc`'s internals as a library for analyzing a crate or for ad hoc emulating of the compiler for cases where [`rustc_driver`] is not flexible enough (i.e. `rustdoc` compiling code and serving output).

The main entry point of [`rustc_interface`] ([`rustc_interface::run_compiler`][i_rc]) takes a configuration variable for the compiler
and a `closure` taking a yet unresolved [`Compiler`].
[`run_compiler`][i_rc] creates a `Compiler` from the configuration and passes it to the `closure`.
Inside the `closure` you can use the `Compiler` to call various functions to compile a crate and get the results.
You can see a minimal example of how to use [`rustc_interface`] [here][example].

You can see an example of how to use the various functions using [`rustc_interface`] needs by looking at the `rustc_driver` implementation,
specifically [`rustc_driver_impl::run_compiler`][rdi_rc]
(not to be confused with [`rustc_interface::run_compiler`][i_rc]).

> **Warning:** By its very nature, the internal compiler APIs are always going
> to be unstable. That said, we do try not to break things unnecessarily.
