# Example: Type checking through `rustc_driver`

[`rustc_driver`] allows you to interact with Rust code at various stages of compilation.

## Getting the type of an expression

To get the type of an expression, use the [`after_analysis`] callback to get a [`TyCtxt`].
The following was tested with <!-- date-check: december 2024 --> `nightly-2024-12-15`:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rustc-driver-interacting-with-the-ast.rs}}
```
