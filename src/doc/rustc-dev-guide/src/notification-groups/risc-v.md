This list will be used to ask for help both in diagnosing and testing
RISC-V-related issues as well as suggestions on how to resolve
interesting questions regarding our RISC-V support.

The group also has an associated Zulip channel ([`#t-compiler/risc-v`])
where people can go to pose questions and discuss RISC-V-specific
topics.

So, if you are interested in participating, please sign up for the
RISC-V group! To do so, open a PR against the [rust-lang/team]
