# Rust for Linux notification group

**Github Label:** [A-rust-for-linux] <br>
**Ping command:** `@rustbot ping rfl`

This list will be used to notify [Rust for Linux (RfL)][rfl] maintainers
when the compiler or the standard library changes in a way that would
break Rust for Linux, since it depends on several unstable flags
and features. The RfL maintainers should then ideally provide support
for resolving the breakage or decide to temporarily accept the breakage
and unblock CI by temporarily removing the RfL CI jobs.

The group also has an associated Zulip stream ([`#rust-for-linux`])
where people can go to ask questions and discuss topics related to Rust
for Linux.

If you are interested in participating, please sign up for the
Rust for Linux group on [Zulip][`#rust-for-linux`]!
