# WASI notification group

**Github Label:** [O-wasi] <br>
**Ping command:** `@rustbot ping wasi`

[O-wasi]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/O-wasi

This list will be used to ask for help both in diagnosing and testing
WASI-related issues as well as suggestions on how to resolve
interesting questions regarding our WASI support.

The group also has an associated Zulip channel ([`#t-compiler/wasm`])
where people can go to pose questions and discuss WASI-specific
topics.

So, if you are interested in participating, please sign up for the
WASI group! To do so, open a PR against the [rust-lang/team]
repository. Just [follow this example][eg], but change the username to
your own!
