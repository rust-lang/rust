# `EarlyBinder` and instantiating parameters

Given an item that introduces a generic parameter `T`, whenever we refer to types inside of `foo` (i.e. the return type or argument types) from outside of `foo` we must take care to handle the generic parameters defined on `foo`. As an example:

```rust,ignore
fn foo<T, U>(a: T, _b: U) -> T { a }

fn main() {
    let c = foo::<i32, u128>(1, 2);
}
```

When type checking `main` we cannot just naively look at the return type of `foo` and assign the type `T` to the variable `c`, The function `main` does not define any generic parameters, `T` is completely meaningless in this context. More generally whenever an item introduces (binds) generic parameters, when accessing types inside the item from outside, the generic parameters must be instantiated with values from the outer item.

In rustc we track this via the [`EarlyBinder`] type, the return type of `foo` is represented as an `EarlyBinder<Ty>` with the only way to access `Ty` being to provide arguments for any generic parameters `Ty` might be using. This is implemented via the [`EarlyBinder::instantiate`] method which discharges the binder returning the inner value with all the generic parameters replaced by the provided arguments.

To go back to our example, when type checking `main` the return type of `foo` would be represented as `EarlyBinder(T/#0)`. Then, because we called the function with `i32, u128` for the generic arguments, we would call `EarlyBinder::instantiate` on the return type with `[i32, u128]` for the args. This would result in an instantiated return type of `i32` that we can use as the type of the local `c`.

Here are some more examples:

```rust,ignore
fn foo<T>() -> Vec<(u32, T)> { Vec::new() }
fn bar() {
    // the return type of `foo` before instantiating it would be:
    // `EarlyBinder(Adt(Vec, &[Tup(&[u32, T/#=0])]))`
    // we then instantiate the binder with `[u64]` resulting in the type:
    // `Adt(Vec, &[Tup(&[u32, u64])])`
    let a = foo::<u64>();
}
```

```rust,ignore
struct Foo<A, B> {
    x: Vec<A>,
    ..
}

fn bar(foo: Foo<u32, f32>) { 
    // the type of `foo`'s `x` field before instantiating it would be:
    // `EarlyBinder(Vec<A/#0>)`
    // we then instantiate the binder with `[u32, f32]` as those are the
    // generic arguments to the `Foo` struct. This results in a type of:
    // `Vec<u32>`
    let y = foo.x;
}
```

In the compiler the `instantiate` call for this is done in [`FieldDef::ty`] ([src][field_def_ty_src]), at some point during type checking `bar` we will wind up calling `FieldDef::ty(x, &[u32, f32])` in order to obtain the type of `foo.x`.

**Note on indices:** It is a bug if the index of a `Param` does not match what the `EarlyBinder` binds. For
example, if the index is out of bounds or the index index of a lifetime corresponds to a type parameter.
These sorts of errors are caught earlier in the compiler during name resolution where we disallow references
to generics parameters introduced by items that should not be nameable by the inner item.

---

As mentioned previously when _outside_ of an item, it is important to instantiate the `EarlyBinder` with generic arguments before accessing the value inside, but the setup for when we are conceptually inside of the binder already is a bit different.

For example:
```rust
impl<T> Trait for Vec<T> {
    fn foo(&self, b: Self) {}
}
```

When constructing a `Ty` to represent the `b` parameter's type we need to get the type of `Self` on the impl that we are inside. This can be acquired by calling the [`type_of`] query with the `impl`'s `DefId`, however, this will return a `EarlyBinder<Ty>` as the impl block binds generic parameters that may have to be discharged if we are outside of the impl.

The `EarlyBinder` type provides an [`instantiate_identity`] function for discharging the binder when you are "already inside of it". This is effectively a more performant version of writing `EarlyBinder::instantiate(GenericArgs::identity_for_item(..))`. Conceptually this discharges the binder by instantiating it with placeholders in the root universe (we will talk about what this means in the next few chapters). In practice though it simply returns the inner value with no modification taking place.
