# `external-clangrt`

This option controls whether the compiler links in its own runtime library for
[sanitizers](./sanitizer.md). Passing this flag makes the compiler *not* link
its own library. For more information, see the section in the sanitizers doc on
[working with other languages.](./sanitizer.md#working-with-other-languages)
