# Contributing to rustc

We'd love to have your help improving `rustc`! To that end, we've written [a
whole book][rustc_dev_guide] on its
internals, how it works, and how to get started working on it. To learn
more, you'll want to check that out.

If you would like to contribute to _this_ book, you can find its source in the
rustc source at [src/doc/rustc][rustc_book].
