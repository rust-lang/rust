# `thumbv8m.base-none-eabi`

**Tier: 2**

Bare-metal target for CPUs in the Baseline [Armv8-M] architecture family,
supporting a subset of the [T32 ISA][t32-isa].

Processors in this family include the:

* [Arm Cortex-M23][cortex-m23]

See [`arm-none-eabi`](arm-none-eabi.md) for information applicable to all
`arm-none-eabi` targets.

This target uses the soft-float ABI: functions which take `f32` or `f64` as
arguments will have those values packed into integer registers. This is the
only option because there is no FPU support in [Armv8-M] Baseline.
