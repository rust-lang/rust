# `*-apple-darwin`

Apple macOS targets.

**Tier: 1**

- `x86_64-apple-darwin`: macOS on 64-bit x86.
- `aarch64-apple-darwin`: macOS on ARM64 (M1-family or later Apple Silicon CPUs).

## Requirements

### OS version

The minimum supported version is macOS 10.12 Sierra on x86, and macOS 11.0 Big
Sur on ARM64.

This version can be raised per-binary by changing the [deployment target],
which might yield more performance optimizations. `rustc` respects the common
environment variables used by Xcode to do so, in this case
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`.

The current default deployment target for `rustc` can be retrieved with
[`rustc --print=deployment-target`][rustc-print].

[rustc-print]: ../command-line-arguments.md#option-print

### Host tooling

The minimum supported OS versions for the host tooling (`rustc`, `cargo`,
etc.) are currently the same as for applications, namely 10.12 on x86 and 11.0
on ARM64.
The minimum supported Xcode version is 9.2.

Building from source likely requires that you can build LLVM from source too,
which [currently][llvm-os] requires Xcode 10.0 and macOS 10.13 (for LLVM 19).

### Binary format

The default binary format is Mach-O, the executable format used on Apple's
platforms.

## Building

These targets are distributed through `rustup`, and otherwise require no
special configuration.

## Testing

There are no special requirements for testing and running this target.

x86 binaries can be run on Apple Silicon by using Rosetta.

## Cross-compilation toolchains and C code

Cross-compilation of these targets are supported using Clang, but may require
Xcode or the macOS SDK (`MacOSX.sdk`) to be available to compile C code and
to link.

The Clang target is suffixed with `-macosx`. Clang's `-darwin` target refers
to Darwin platforms in general (macOS/iOS/tvOS/watchOS/visionOS), and requires
the `-mmacosx-version-min=...`, `-miphoneos-version-min=...` or similar flags
to disambiguate.

The path to the SDK can be passed to `rustc` using the common `SDKROOT`
environment variable.
