# `thumbv7m-none-eabi`

**Tier: 2**

Bare-metal target for CPUs in the [Armv7-M] architecture family, supporting a
subset of the [T32 ISA][t32-isa].

Processors in this family include the:

* [Arm Cortex-M3][cortex-m3]

See [`arm-none-eabi`](arm-none-eabi.md) for information applicable to all
`arm-none-eabi` targets.

This target uses the soft-float ABI: functions which take `f32` or `f64` as
arguments will have those values packed into integer registers. This is the
only option because there is no FPU support in [Armv7-M].

## Target CPU and Target Feature options

See [the bare-metal Arm
docs](arm-none-eabi.md#target-cpu-and-target-feature-options) for details on how
to use these flags.

### Table of supported CPUs

| CPU        | FPU | Target CPU  | Target Features       |
| ---------- | --- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Cortex-M3  | No  | `cortex-m3` | None                  |

### Arm Cortex-M3

The target CPU option is `cortex-m3`.

There are no relevant feature flags, and the FPU is not available.
