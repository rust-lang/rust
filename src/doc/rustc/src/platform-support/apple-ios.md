# `*-apple-ios`

Apple iOS / iPadOS targets.

**Tier: 2 (without Host Tools)**

- `aarch64-apple-ios`: Apple iOS on ARM64.
- `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`: Apple iOS Simulator on ARM64.
- `x86_64-apple-ios`: Apple iOS Simulator on 64-bit x86.

**Tier: 3**

- `armv7s-apple-ios`: Apple iOS on Armv7-A.
- `i386-apple-ios`: Apple iOS Simulator on 32-bit x86.

## Requirements

These targets are cross-compiled, and require the corresponding iOS SDK
(`iPhoneOS.sdk` or `iPhoneSimulator.sdk`), as provided by Xcode. To build the
ARM64 targets, Xcode 12 or higher is required.

The path to the SDK can be passed to `rustc` using the common `SDKROOT`
environment variable, or will be inferred when compiling on host macOS using
roughly the same logic as `xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-path`.

### OS version

The minimum supported version is iOS 10.0.

This can be raised per-binary by changing the deployment target. `rustc`
respects the common environment variables used by Xcode to do so, in this
case `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`.

## Building the target

The tier 2 targets are distributed through `rustup`, and can be installed
using one of:
```console
$ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios
$ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim
$ rustup target add x86_64-apple-ios
```

The tier 3 targets can be built by enabling them for a `rustc` build in
`bootstrap.toml`, by adding, for example:

```toml
[build]
target = ["armv7s-apple-ios", "i386-apple-ios"]
```

Using the unstable `-Zbuild-std` with a nightly Cargo may also work.

## Building Rust programs

Rust programs can be built for these targets by specifying `--target`, if
`rustc` has been built with support for them. For example:

```console
$ rustc --target aarch64-apple-ios your-code.rs
```

Or if using Cargo and `-Zbuild-std`:
```console
$ cargo +nightly build -Zbuild-std --target armv7s-apple-ios
```

The simulator variants can be differentiated from the variants running
on-device with the `target_env = "sim"` cfg (or `target_abi = "sim"` before
Rust CURRENT_RUSTC_VERSION).

```rust
if cfg!(all(target_vendor = "apple", target_env = "sim")) {
    // Do something on the iOS/tvOS/visionOS/watchOS Simulator.
} else {
    // Everything else, like Windows and non-Simulator iOS.
}
```

This is similar to the `TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR` define in C code.

## Testing

Running and testing your code naturally requires either an actual device
running iOS, or the equivalent Xcode simulator environment. There exists
several tools in the ecosystem for running a Cargo project on one of these.
One of these tools is [`cargo-dinghy`]. [madsmtm/objc2#459] contains a more
exhaustive list.

See also [testing on emulators in the `rustc-dev-guide`][test-sim] for
instructions on running the standard library's test suite.
