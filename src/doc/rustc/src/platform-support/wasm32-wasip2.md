# `wasm32-wasip2`

**Tier: 2**

The `wasm32-wasip2` target is a new and still (as of January 2024) an
experimental target. This target is an extension to `wasm32-wasip1` target,
originally known as `wasm32-wasi`. It is the next evolution in the development of
wasi (the [WebAssembly System Interface](https://wasi.dev)) that uses the WebAssembly
[component model] to allow for a standardized set of syscalls that are intended to empower
WebAssembly binaries with native host capabilities.

## Requirements

This target is cross-compiled. The target supports `std` fully.

## Platform requirements

The WebAssembly runtime should support the wasi preview 2 API set. Runtimes also
are required to support components since this target outputs a component as
opposed to a core wasm module. As of the time of this writing Wasmtime 17 and
above is able to run this target natively with no extra flags.

## Building the target

To build this target first acquire a copy of
[`wasi-sdk`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/). At this time version 22
is the minimum needed.

Next configure the `WASI_SDK_PATH` environment variable to point to where this
is installed. For example:

```text
export WASI_SDK_PATH=/path/to/wasi-sdk-22.0
```

Next be sure to enable LLD when building Rust from source as LLVM's `wasm-ld`
driver for LLD is required when linking WebAssembly code together. Rust's build
system will automatically pick up any necessary binaries and programs from
`WASI_SDK_PATH`.

## Testing

This target is not tested in CI at this time. Locally it can be tested with a
`wasmtime` binary in `PATH` like so:

```text
./x.py test --target wasm32-wasip2 tests/ui
```

## Conditionally compiling code

It's recommended to conditionally compile code for this target with:

```text
#[cfg(all(target_os = "wasi", target_env = "p2"))]
```

## Enabled WebAssembly features

The default set of WebAssembly features enabled for compilation is currently the
same as [`wasm32-unknown-unknown`](./wasm32-unknown-unknown.md). See the
documentation there for more information.
