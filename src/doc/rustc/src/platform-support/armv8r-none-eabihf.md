# `armv8r-none-eabihf`

* **Tier: 3**
* **Library Support:** core and alloc (bare-metal, `#![no_std]`)

Bare-metal target for CPUs in the Armv8-R architecture family, supporting
dual ARM/Thumb mode, with ARM mode as the default.

Processors in this family include the Arm [Cortex-R52][cortex-r52]
and [Cortex-R52+][cortex-r52-plus].

See [`arm-none-eabi`](arm-none-eabi.md) for information applicable to all
`arm-none-eabi` targets.

## Requirements

The Cortex-R52 family always includes a floating-point unit, so there is no
non-`hf` version of this target. The floating-point features assumed by this
target are those of the single-precision-only config of the Cortex-R52, which
has 16 double-precision registers, accessible as 32 single-precision registers.
The other variant of Cortex-R52 includes double-precision, 32 double-precision
registers, and Advanced SIMD (Neon).

The manual refers to this as the "Full Advanced SIMD config". To compile code
for this variant, use: `-C target-feature=+fp64,+d32,+neon`. See the [Advanced
SIMD and floating-point support][fpu] section of the Cortex-R52 Processor
Technical Reference Manual for more details.
