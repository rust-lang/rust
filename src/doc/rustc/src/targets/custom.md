# Custom Targets

If you'd like to build for a target that is not yet supported by `rustc`, you can use a
"custom target specification" to define a target. These target specification files
are JSON. To see the JSON for the host target, you can run:

```bash
rustc +nightly -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json
```

To see it for a different target, add the `--target` flag:

```bash
rustc +nightly -Z unstable-options --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --print target-spec-json
```

To use a custom target, see the (unstable) [`build-std` feature](../../cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std) of `cargo`.

## Custom Target Lookup Path

When `rustc` is given an option `--target=TARGET` (where `TARGET` is any string), it uses the following logic:
1. if `TARGET` is the name of a built-in target, use that
2. if `TARGET` is a path to a file, read that file as a json target
3. otherwise, search the colon-seperated list of directories found
   in the `RUST_TARGET_PATH` environment variable from left to right
   for a file named `TARGET.json`.

These steps are tried in order, so if there are multple potentially valid
interpretations for a target, whichever is found first will take priority.
If none of these methods find a target, an error is thrown.
