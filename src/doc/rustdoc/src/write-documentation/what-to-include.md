# What to include (and exclude)

It is easy to say everything must be documented in a project and often times
that is correct, but how can we get there, and are there things that don't
belong?

At the top of the `src/lib.rs` or `main.rs` file in your binary project, include
the following attribute:

```rust
#![warn(missing_docs)]
```

Now run `cargo doc` and examine the output.  Here's a sample:

```text
 Documenting docdemo v0.1.0 (/Users/username/docdemo)
warning: missing documentation for the crate
 --> src/main.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / #![warn(missing_docs)]
2 | |
3 | | fn main() {
4 | |     println!("Hello, world!");
5 | | }
  | |_^
  |
note: the lint level is defined here
 --> src/main.rs:1:9
  |
1 | #![warn(missing_docs)]
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^

warning: 1 warning emitted

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.96s
```

As a library author, adding the lint `#![deny(missing_docs)]` is a great way to
ensure the project does not drift away from being documented well, and
`#![warn(missing_docs)]` is a good way to move towards comprehensive
documentation.

There are more lints in the upcoming chapter [Lints][rustdoc-lints].

## Examples

Of course this is contrived to be simple, but part of the power of documentation
is showing code that is easy to follow, rather than being realistic.  Docs often
take shortcuts with error handling because examples can become complicated to
follow with all the necessary set up required for a simple example.

`Async` is a good example of this.  In order to execute an `async` example, an
executor needs to be available.  Examples will often shortcut this, and leave
users to figure out how to put the `async` code into their own runtime.

It is preferred that `unwrap()` not be used inside an example, and some of the
error handling components be hidden if they make the example too difficult to
follow.

``````text
/// Example
/// ```rust
/// let fourtytwo = "42".parse::<u32>()?;
/// println!("{} + 10 = {}", fourtytwo, fourtytwo+10);
/// ```
``````

When rustdoc wraps that in a main function, it will fail to compile because the
`ParseIntError` trait is not implemented.  In order to help both your audience
and your test suite, this example needs some additional code:

``````text
/// Example
/// ```rust
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), std::num::ParseIntError> {
/// let fortytwo = "42".parse::<u32>()?;
/// println!("{} + 10 = {}", fortytwo, fortytwo+10);
/// #     Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
``````

The example is the same on the doc page, but has that extra information
available to anyone trying to use your crate.  More about tests in the
upcoming [Documentation tests] chapter.

## What to Exclude

Certain parts of your public interface may be included by default in the output
of rustdoc.  The attribute `#[doc(hidden)]` can hide implementation details
to encourage idiomatic use of the crate.

For example, an internal `macro!` that makes the crate easier to implement can
become a footgun for users when it appears in the public documentation.  An
internal `Error` type may exist, and `impl` details should be hidden, as
detailed in the [API Guidelines].

## Customizing the output

It is possible to pass a custom css file to `rustdoc` and style the
documentation.

```bash
rustdoc --extend-css custom.css src/lib.rs
```

A good example of using this feature to create a dark theme is documented [on
this blog].  Just remember, dark theme is already included in the rustdoc output
by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right. Adding additional options to the
themes are as easy as creating a custom theme `.css` file and using the following
syntax:

```bash
rustdoc --theme awesome.css src/lib.rs
```

Here is an example of a new theme, [Ayu].
