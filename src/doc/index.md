% Rust Documentation

Welcome to the Rust documentation! You can use the section headings above
to jump to any particular section.

# Getting Started

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read is the
introduction to [The Rust Programming Language](book/index.html). It'll give
you a good idea of what Rust is like.

The book provides a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its
concepts. Upon completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust
developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind
Rust.

[Rust By Example][rbe] teaches you Rust through a series of small
examples.

# Language Reference

Rust does not have an exact specification yet, but an effort to describe as much of
the language in as much detail as possible is in [the reference](reference.html).

# Standard Library Reference

We have [API documentation for the entire standard
library](std/index.html). There's a list of crates on the left with more
specific sections, or you can use the search bar at the top to search for
something if you know its name.

# The Rustonomicon

[The Rustonomicon] is an entire book dedicated to explaining
how to write `unsafe` Rust code. It is for advanced Rust programmers.

[The Rustonomicon]: nomicon/index.html

# Tools

[Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/index.html) is the Rust package manager providing access to libraries
beyond the standard one, and its website contains lots of good documentation.

[`rustdoc`](book/documentation.html) is the Rust's documentation generator, a tool converting
annotated source code into HTML docs.

# FAQs

There are questions that are asked quite often, so we've made FAQs for them:

* [Language Design FAQ](complement-design-faq.html)
* [Language FAQ](complement-lang-faq.html)
* [Project FAQ](complement-project-faq.html)
* [How to submit a bug report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports)

# The Error Index

If you encounter an error while compiling your code you may be able to look it
up in the [Rust Compiler Error Index](error-index.html).
