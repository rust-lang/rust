% Rust Documentation

Welcome to the Rust documentation! You can use the section headings above
to jump to any particular section.

# Getting Started

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read is the
introduction to [The Rust Programming Language](book/index.html). It'll give
you a good idea of what Rust is like.

The book provides a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its
concepts. Upon completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust
developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind
Rust.

[Rust By Example][rbe] teaches you Rust through a series of small
examples.

# Language Reference

Rust does not have an exact specification yet, but an effort to describe as much of
the language in as much detail as possible is in [the reference](reference.html).

# Standard Library Reference

We have [API documentation for the entire standard
library](std/index.html). There's a list of crates on the left with more
specific sections, or you can use the search bar at the top to search for
something if you know its name.

# Tools

[Cargo](https://crates.io) is the Rust's package manager providing access to libraries
beyond the standard one, and its website contains lots of good documentation.

[`rustdoc`](book/documentation.html) is the Rust's documentation generator, a tool converting
annotated source code into HTML docs.

A bunch of non-official tools are available, such as [Racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer)
(code completion engine), or [rustfmt](https://github.com/nrc/rustfmt) (source code formatter),
or text editor plugins.

# Community & Getting Help

If you need help with something, or just want to talk about Rust with others,
there are a few places you can do that:

The Rust IRC channels on [irc.mozilla.org](irc://irc.mozilla.org/) are the
fastest way to get help.
[`#rust`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust) is
the general discussion channel, and you'll find people willing to help you with
any questions you may have.

There are also three specialty channels:
[`#rust-gamedev`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-gamedev)
and
[`#rust-osdev`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-osdev)
are for game development and operating system development, respectively.
There's also
[`#rust-internals`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-internals), which is for discussion of the development of Rust itself.

You can also get help on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust). Searching for your
problem might reveal someone who has asked it before!

There is an active [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/rust) with lots of
discussion and news about Rust.

There is also a [user forum](https://users.rust-lang.org), for all
user-oriented discussion, and a [developer
forum](https://internals.rust-lang.org/), where the development of Rust
itself is discussed.

# FAQs

There are questions that are asked quite often, so we've made FAQs for them:

* [Language Design FAQ](complement-design-faq.html)
* [Language FAQ](complement-lang-faq.html)
* [Project FAQ](complement-project-faq.html)
* [How to submit a bug report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports)

# The Error Index

If you encounter an error while compiling your code you may be able to look it
up in the [Rust Compiler Error Index](error-index.html).

# Community Translations

Several projects have been started to translate the documentation into other
languages:

- [Russian](https://github.com/kgv/rust_book_ru)
- [Korean](https://github.com/rust-kr/doc.rust-kr.org)
- [Chinese](https://github.com/KaiserY/rust-book-chinese)
- [Spanish](https://goyox86.github.io/elpr)
- [German](https://panicbit.github.io/rustbook-de)
