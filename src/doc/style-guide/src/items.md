# Items

Items consist of the set of things permitted at the top level of a module.
However, Rust also allows some items to appear within some other types of
items, such as within a function. The same formatting conventions apply whether
an item appears at module level or within another item.

`extern crate` statements must be first in a file. They must be ordered
alphabetically.

`use` statements, and module *declarations* (`mod foo;`, not `mod { ... }`)
must come before other items. Put imports before module declarations.
Version-sort each, except that `self` and `super` must come before any other
names.

Don't automatically move module declarations annotated with `#[macro_use]`,
since that might change semantics.

## Function definitions

In Rust, people often find functions by searching for `fn [function-name]`, so
the formatting of function definitions must enable this.

The proper ordering and spacing is:

```rust
[pub] [unsafe] [extern ["ABI"]] fn foo(arg1: i32, arg2: i32) -> i32 {
    ...
}
```

Avoid comments within the signature itself.

If the function signature does not fit on one line, then break after the opening
parenthesis and before the closing parenthesis and put each argument on its own
block-indented line. For example,

```rust
fn foo(
    arg1: i32,
    arg2: i32,
) -> i32 {
    ...
}
```

Note the trailing comma on the last argument.

## Tuples and tuple structs

Write the type list as you would a parameter list to a function.

Build a tuple or tuple struct as you would call a function.

### Single-line

```rust
struct Bar(Type1, Type2);

let x = Bar(11, 22);
let y = (11, 22, 33);
```

## Enums

In the declaration, put each variant on its own line, block indented.

Format each variant accordingly as either a struct (but without the `struct`
keyword), a tuple struct, or an identifier (which doesn't require special
formatting):

```rust
enum FooBar {
    First(u32),
    Second,
    Error {
        err: Box<Error>,
        line: u32,
    },
}
```

If a struct variant is [*small*](index.html#small-items), format it on one
line. In this case, do not use a trailing comma for the field list, but do put
spaces around each brace:

```rust
enum FooBar {
    Error { err: Box<Error>, line: u32 },
}
```

In an enum with multiple struct variants, if any struct variant is written on
multiple lines, use the multi-line formatting for all struct variants. However,
such a situation might be an indication that you should factor out the fields
of the variant into their own struct.

## Structs and Unions

Struct names follow on the same line as the `struct` keyword, with the opening
brace on the same line when it fits within the right margin. All struct fields
are indented once and end with a trailing comma. The closing brace is not
indented and appears on its own line.

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: A,
    b: B,
}
```

If and only if the type of a field does not fit within the right margin, it is
pulled down to its own line and indented again.

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: A,
    long_name:
        LongType,
}
```

Prefer using a unit struct (e.g., `struct Foo;`) to an empty struct (e.g.,
`struct Foo();` or `struct Foo {}`, these only exist to simplify code
generation), but if you must use an empty struct, keep it on one line with no
space between the braces: `struct Foo;` or `struct Foo {}`.

The same guidelines are used for untagged union declarations.

```rust
union Foo {
    a: A,
    b: B,
    long_name:
        LongType,
}
```

## Tuple structs

Put the whole struct on one line if possible. Separate types within the
parentheses using a comma and space. Don't use a trailing comma for a
single-line tuple struct. Don't put spaces around the parentheses or semicolon:

```rust
pub struct Foo(String, u8);
```

Prefer unit structs to empty tuple structs (these only exist to simplify code
generation), e.g., `struct Foo;` rather than `struct Foo();`.

For more than a few fields (in particular if the tuple struct does not fit on
one line), prefer a proper struct with named fields.

For a multi-line tuple struct, block-format the fields with a field on each
line and a trailing comma:

```rust
pub struct Foo(
    String,
    u8,
);
```

## Traits

Use block-indent for trait items. If there are no items, format the trait (including its `{}`)
on a single line. Otherwise, break after the opening brace and before
the closing brace:

```rust
trait Foo {}

pub trait Bar {
    ...
}
```

If the trait has bounds, put a space after the colon but not before,
and put spaces around each `+`, e.g.,

```rust
trait Foo: Debug + Bar {}
```

Prefer not to line-break in the bounds if possible (consider using a `where`
clause). Prefer to break between bounds than to break any individual bound. If
you must break the bounds, put each bound (including the first) on its own
block-indented line, break before the `+` and put the opening brace on its own
line:

```rust
pub trait IndexRanges:
    Index<Range<usize>, Output=Self>
    + Index<RangeTo<usize>, Output=Self>
    + Index<RangeFrom<usize>, Output=Self>
    + Index<RangeFull, Output=Self>
{
    ...
}
```

## Impls

Use block-indent for impl items. If there are no items, format the impl
(including its `{}`) on a single line. Otherwise, break after the opening brace
and before the closing brace:

```rust
impl Foo {}

impl Bar for Foo {
    ...
}
```

Avoid line-breaking in the signature if possible. If a line break is required in
a non-inherent impl, break immediately before `for`, block indent the concrete type
and put the opening brace on its own line:

```rust
impl Bar
    for Foo
{
    ...
}
```

## Extern crate

`extern crate foo;`

Use spaces around keywords, no spaces around the semicolon.

## Modules

```rust
mod foo {
}
```

```rust
mod foo;
```

Use spaces around keywords and before the opening brace, no spaces around the
semicolon.

## `macro_rules!`

Use `{}` for the full definition of the macro.

```rust
macro_rules! foo {
}
```

## Generics

Prefer to put a generics clause on one line. Break other parts of an item
declaration rather than line-breaking a generics clause. If a generics clause is
large enough to require line-breaking, prefer a `where` clause instead.

Do not put spaces before or after `<` nor before `>`. Only put a space after
`>` if it is followed by a word or opening brace, not an opening parenthesis.
Put a space after each comma. Do not use a trailing comma for a single-line
generics clause.

```rust
fn foo<T: Display, U: Debug>(x: Vec<T>, y: Vec<U>) ...

impl<T: Display, U: Debug> SomeType<T, U> { ...
```

If the generics clause must be formatted across multiple lines, put each
parameter on its own block-indented line, break after the opening `<` and
before the closing `>`, and use a trailing comma.

```rust
fn foo<
    T: Display,
    U: Debug,
>(x: Vec<T>, y: Vec<U>) ...
```

If an associated type is bound in a generic type, put spaces around the `=`:

```rust
<T: Example<Item = u32>>
```

Prefer to use single-letter names for generic parameters.

## `where` clauses

These rules apply for `where` clauses on any item.

If a where clause is short, and appears on a short one-line function
declaration with no body or on a short type with no `=`, format it on
the same line as the declaration:

```rust
fn new(&self) -> Self where Self: Sized;

type Item<'a>: SomeTrait where Self: 'a;
```

Otherwise, if immediately following a closing bracket of any kind, write the
keyword `where` on the same line, with a space before it.

Otherwise, put `where` on a new line at the same indentation level. Put each
component of a `where` clause on its own line, block-indented. Use a trailing
comma, unless the clause is terminated with a semicolon. If the `where` clause
is followed by a block (or assignment), start that block on a new line.
Examples:

```rust
fn function<T, U>(args)
where
    T: Bound,
    U: AnotherBound,
{
    body
}

fn foo<T>(
    args
) -> ReturnType
where
    T: Bound,
{
    body
}

fn foo<T, U>(
    args,
) where
    T: Bound,
    U: AnotherBound,
{
    body
}

fn foo<T, U>(
    args
) -> ReturnType
where
    T: Bound,
    U: AnotherBound;  // Note, no trailing comma.

// Note that where clauses on `type` aliases are not enforced and should not
// be used.
type Foo<T>
where
    T: Bound
= Bar<T>;
```

If a `where` clause is very short, prefer using an inline bound on the type
parameter if possible.

If a component of a `where` clause does not fit and contains `+`, break it
before each `+` and block-indent the continuation lines. Put each bound on its
own line. E.g.,

```rust
impl<T: ?Sized, Idx> IndexRanges<Idx> for T
where
    T: Index<Range<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeTo<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeFrom<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeInclusive<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeToInclusive<Idx>, Output = Self::Output>
        + Index<RangeFull>,
```

## Type aliases

Keep type aliases on one line when they fit. If necessary to break the line, do
so before the `=`, and block-indent the right-hand side:

```rust
pub type Foo = Bar<T>;

// If multi-line is required
type VeryLongType<T, U: SomeBound>
    = AnEvenLongerType<T, U, Foo<T>>;
```

When there is a trailing `where` clause after the type, and no `where` clause
present before the type, break before the `=` and indent. Then break before the
`where` keyword and format the clauses normally, e.g.,

```rust
// With only a trailing where clause
type VeryLongType<T, U>
    = AnEvenLongerType<T, U, Foo<T>>
where
    T: U::AnAssociatedType,
    U: SomeBound;
```

When there is a `where` clause before the type, format it normally, and break
after the last clause. Do not indent before the `=` to leave it visually
distinct from the indented clauses that precede it. If there is additionally a
`where` clause after the type, break before the `where` keyword and format the
clauses normally.

```rust
// With only a preceding where clause.
type WithPrecedingWC<T, U>
where
    T: U::AnAssociatedType,
    U: SomeBound,
= AnEvenLongerType<T, U, Foo<T>>;

// Or with both a preceding and trailing where clause.
type WithPrecedingWC<T, U>
where
    T: U::AnAssociatedType,
    U: SomeBound,
= AnEvenLongerType<T, U, Foo<T>>
where
    T: U::AnAssociatedType2,
    U: SomeBound2;
```

## Associated types

Format associated types like type aliases. Where an associated type has a
bound, put a space after the colon but not before:

```rust
type Foo: Bar;
```

If an associated type is short, has no `=`, and has a `where` clause with only
one entry, format the entire type declaration including the `where` clause on
the same line if it fits:

```rust
type Item<'a> where Self: 'a;
type Item<'a>: PartialEq + Send where Self: 'a;
```

If the associated type has a `=`, or if the `where` clause contains multiple
entries, format it across multiple lines as with a type alias.

## extern items

When writing extern items (such as `extern "C" fn`), always specify the ABI.
For example, write `extern "C" fn foo ...` or `unsafe extern "C" { ...}`
and avoid `extern fn foo ...` and `unsafe extern { ... }`.

## Imports (`use` statements)

Format imports on one line where possible. Don't put spaces around braces.

```rust
use a::b::c;
use a::b::d::*;
use a::b::{foo, bar, baz};
```

### Large list imports

Prefer to use multiple imports rather than a multi-line import. However, tools
should not split imports by default.

If an import does require multiple lines (either because a list of single names
does not fit within the max width, or because of the rules for nested imports
below), then break after the opening brace and before the closing brace, use a
trailing comma, and block indent the names.

```rust
// Prefer
foo::{long, list, of, imports};
foo::{more, imports};

// If necessary
foo::{
    long, list, of, imports, more,
    imports,  // Note trailing comma
};
```

### Ordering of imports

A *group* of imports is a set of imports on the same or sequential lines. One or
more blank lines or other items (e.g., a function) separate groups of imports.

Within a group of imports, imports must be version-sorted. Groups of imports
must not be merged or re-ordered.

E.g., input:

```rust
use d;
use c;

use b;
use a;
```

output:

```rust
use c;
use d;

use a;
use b;
```

Because of `macro_use`, attributes must also start a new group and prevent
re-ordering.

### Ordering list import

Names in a list import must be version-sorted, except that:
- `self` and `super` always come first if present, and
- groups and glob imports always come last if present.

This applies recursively. For example, `a::*` comes before `b::a` but `a::b`
comes before `a::*`. E.g., `use foo::bar::{a, b::c, b::d, b::d::{x, y, z},
b::{self, r, s}};`.

### Normalisation

Tools must make the following normalisations, recursively:

- `use a::self;` -> `use a;`
- `use a::{};` -> (nothing)
- `use a::{b};` -> `use a::b;`

Tools must not otherwise merge or un-merge import lists or adjust glob imports
(without an explicit option).

### Nested imports

If there are any nested imports in a list import, then use the multi-line form,
even if the import fits on one line. Each nested import must be on its own line,
but non-nested imports must be grouped on as few lines as possible.

For example,

```rust
use a::b::{
    x, y, z,
    u::{...},
    w::{...},
};
```

### Merging/un-merging imports

An example:

```rust
// Un-merged
use a::b;
use a::c::d;

// Merged
use a::{b, c::d};
```

Tools must not merge or un-merge imports by default. They may offer merging or
un-merging as an option.
