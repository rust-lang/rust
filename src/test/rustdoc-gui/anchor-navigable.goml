// The `impl Foo` heading underneath `Implementations` has a §
// anchor to its left (used for linking to that heading). The anchor only shows
// up when hovering the `impl Foo`. This test ensures there's no gap between the
// anchor and the `impl Foo`. If there were a gap, this would cause an annoying
// problem: you hover `impl Foo` to see the anchor, then when you move your
// mouse to the left, the anchor disappears before you reach it.
