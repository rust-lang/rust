// This tests the extra note reported when a type error deals with
// seemingly identical types.
// The main use case of this error is when there are two crates
// (generally different versions of the same crate) with the same name
// causing a type mismatch. Here, we simulate that error using block-scoped
// aliased `extern crate` declarations.

fn main() {
    let foo2 = {extern crate crate_a2 as a; a::Foo};
    let bar2 = {extern crate crate_a2 as a; a::bar()};
    {
        extern crate crate_a1 as a;
        a::try_foo(foo2); //~ ERROR mismatched types
                          //~^ NOTE Perhaps two different versions of crate `crate_a1`
        a::try_bar(bar2); //~ ERROR mismatched types
