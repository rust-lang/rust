   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
   = note: the following trait is implemented but not in scope; perhaps add a `use` for it:
           `use foo::T;`
   = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
