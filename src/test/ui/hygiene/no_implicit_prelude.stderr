   = help: have you added the `#[macro_use]` on the module/import?
   = note: this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate (in Nightly builds, run with -Z external-macro-backtrace for more info)

   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
   = note: the following trait is implemented but not in scope, perhaps add a `use` for it:
           `use std::clone::Clone;`

error: aborting due to 3 previous errors
