LL |     produces_async! {}
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected identifier, found reserved keyword
   |
   = note: this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate (in Nightly builds, run with -Z external-macro-backtrace for more info)
help: you can escape reserved keywords to use them as identifiers

LL | (  ) => ( pub fn r#async (  ) {  } )
   |                  ^^^^^^^
