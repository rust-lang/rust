error[E0277]: the trait bound `!: Test` is not satisfied

   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Test` is not implemented for `!`
   |
   = note: the trait is implemented for `()`. Possibly this error has been caused by changes to Rust's type-inference algorithm (see issue #48950 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48950> for more information). Consider whether you meant to use the type `()` here instead.
