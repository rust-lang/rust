error[E0038]: the trait `Foo` cannot be made into an object
  --> $DIR/object-safety-no-static.rs:22:27
   |
LL |     let b: Box<dyn Foo> = Box::new(Bar);
   |                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Foo` cannot be made into an object
   |
note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL | trait Foo {
   |       --- this trait cannot be made into an object...
LL |     fn foo() {}
   |        ^^^ ...because associated function `foo` has no `self` parameter
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `CoerceUnsized<Box<dyn Foo>>` for `Box<Bar>`
   = note: required by cast to type `Box<dyn Foo>`
help: consider turning `foo` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument
   |
LL |     fn foo(&self) {}
   |            ^^^^^
help: alternatively, consider constraining `foo` so it does not apply to trait objects
   |
LL |     fn foo() where Self: Sized {}
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
