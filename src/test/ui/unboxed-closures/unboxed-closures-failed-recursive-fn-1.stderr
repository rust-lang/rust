error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `factorial`, which is owned by the current function

LL |     let f = |x: u32| -> u32 {
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ may outlive borrowed value `factorial`

help: to force the closure to take ownership of `factorial` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
