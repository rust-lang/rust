   = help: the following implementations were found:
             <&T as Clone>
             <*const T as Clone>
             <*mut T as Clone>
   = note: `Clone` is implemented for `&T`, but not for `&mut T`
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Clone` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
