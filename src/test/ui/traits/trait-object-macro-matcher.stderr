error[E0038]: the trait `Copy` cannot be made into an object
  --> $DIR/trait-object-macro-matcher.rs:8:8

LL |     m!(dyn Copy + Send + 'static);
   |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Copy` cannot be made into an object

   = note: the trait cannot be made into an object because it requires `Self: Sized`
   = note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>
