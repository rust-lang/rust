error[E0495]: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for lifetime parameter `'d` due to conflicting requirements

LL | fn visit_seq<'d, 'a: 'd>() -> <&'a () as Visitor<'d>>::Value {}
   |    ^^^^^^^^^

note: first, the lifetime cannot outlive the lifetime `'d` as defined here...

LL | fn visit_seq<'d, 'a: 'd>() -> <&'a () as Visitor<'d>>::Value {}

note: ...but the lifetime must also be valid for the lifetime `'a` as defined here...

note: ...so that the types are compatible
