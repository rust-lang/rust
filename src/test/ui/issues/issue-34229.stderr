   |                                              ^^^^^^^^^^ no implementation for `Comparable < Comparable` and `Comparable > Comparable`

   = help: the trait `PartialOrd` is not implemented for `Comparable`
   = note: required by `std::cmp::PartialOrd::partial_cmp`
   = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
