error[E0277]: `?` couldn't convert the error to `()`
  --> $DIR/issue-32709.rs:4:11

LL | fn a() -> Result<i32, ()> {
   |           --------------- expected `()` because of this
LL |     Err(5)?;
   |           ^ the trait `From<{integer}>` is not implemented for `()`
   |
   = note: the question mark operation (`?`) implicitly performs a conversion on the error value using the `From` trait
   = help: the following other types implement trait `FromResidual<R>`:
             <Result<T, F> as FromResidual<Result<Infallible, E>>>
             <Result<T, F> as FromResidual<Yeet<E>>>
   = note: required for `Result<i32, ()>` to implement `FromResidual<Result<Infallible, {integer}>>`

error: aborting due to previous error
