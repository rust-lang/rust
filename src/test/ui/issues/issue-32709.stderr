error[E0277]: `?` couldn't convert the error to `()`

   = note: the question mark operation (`?`) implicitly performs a conversion on the error value using the `From` trait
   = help: the trait `FromResidual<Result<Infallible, E>>` is implemented for `Result<T, F>`
   = note: required for `Result<i32, ()>` to implement `FromResidual<Result<Infallible, {integer}>>`
