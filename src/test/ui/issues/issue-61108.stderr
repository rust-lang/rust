error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `bad_letters`
  --> $DIR/issue-61108.rs:6:5
   |
LL |     let mut bad_letters = vec!['e', 't', 'o', 'i'];
   |         --------------- move occurs because `bad_letters` has type `Vec<char>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     for l in bad_letters {
   |              -----------
   |              |
   |              `bad_letters` moved due to this implicit call to `.into_iter()`
   |              help: consider borrowing to avoid moving into the for loop: `&bad_letters`
...
LL |     bad_letters.push('s');
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `bad_letters`
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/iter/traits/collect.rs:LL:COL

LL |     fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter;
   |                  ^^^^
