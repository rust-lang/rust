error[E0594]: cannot assign to `*my_ref` which is behind a `&` reference
  --> $DIR/issue-51244.rs:3:5

LL |     let ref my_ref @ _ = 0;
   |         -------------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `ref mut my_ref @ _`
LL |     *my_ref = 0;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ `my_ref` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be written

error: aborting due to previous error
