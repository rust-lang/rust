error[E0308]: mismatched types

LL | const RANGE: RangeInclusive<i32> = 0..=255;
   | ------------------------------------------- constant defined here
...
LL |     match n {
   |           - this expression has type `i32`
LL |         RANGE => {}
   |         ^^^^^
   |         |
   |         expected `i32`, found struct `RangeInclusive`
   |         `RANGE` is interpreted as a constant, not a new binding
   |
   = note: expected type `i32`
            found struct `RangeInclusive<i32>`
   = note: constants only support matching by type, if you meant to match against a range of values, consider using a range pattern like `min ..= max` in the match block
