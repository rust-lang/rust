   |      - inferred to be a `FnMut` closure
LL |         &mut x
   |         ^^^^^^ returns a reference to a captured variable which escapes the closure body

   = note: `FnMut` closures only have access to their captured variables while they are executing...
   = note: ...therefore, they cannot allow references to captured variables to escape
