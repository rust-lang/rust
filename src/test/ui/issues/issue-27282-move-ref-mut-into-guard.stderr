LL |             if { (|| { let bar = foo; bar.take() })(); false } => {},

   |                   |              move occurs because `foo` has type `&mut std::option::Option<&i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |                   |              move occurs due to use in closure
   |                   move out of `foo` occurs here
   |
   = note: variables bound in patterns cannot be moved from until after the end of the pattern guard
