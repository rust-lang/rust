error[E0038]: the trait `Qiz` cannot be made into an object
  --> $DIR/issue-19380.rs:11:3
   |
LL | trait Qiz {
   |       --- this trait cannot be made into an object...
LL |   fn qiz();
   |      --- ...because associated function `qiz` has no `self` parameter
...
LL |   foos: &'static [&'static (dyn Qiz + 'static)]
   |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Qiz` cannot be made into an object
   |
help: consider turning `qiz` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument or constraining it so it does not apply to trait objects
   |
LL |   fn qiz() where Self: Sized;
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
