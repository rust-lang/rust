   = note: try using `<*const T>::as_ref()` to get a reference to the type behind the pointer: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.as_ref
   = note: using `<*const T>::as_ref()` on a pointer which is unaligned or points to invalid or uninitialized memory is undefined behavior
   = note: the method `to_string` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `*const u8: std::fmt::Display`
           which is required by `*const u8: ToString`

error: aborting due to previous error
