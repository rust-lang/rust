error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/issue-24357.rs:6:8
   |
LL |    let f = move || { let y = x; };
   |            ------- value moved (into closure) here
LL |
LL |    let z = x;
   |        ^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `x` has type `NoCopy`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

error: aborting due to previous error
