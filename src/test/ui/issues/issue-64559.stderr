error[E0382]: use of moved value: `orig`
  --> $DIR/issue-64559.rs:4:20
   |
LL |     let orig = vec![true];
   |         ---- move occurs because `orig` has type `Vec<bool>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     for _val in orig {}
   |                 ----
   |                 |
   |                 `orig` moved due to this implicit call to `.into_iter()`
   |                 help: consider borrowing to avoid moving into the for loop: `&orig`
LL |     let _closure = || orig;
   |                    ^^ ---- use occurs due to use in closure
   |                    |
   |                    value used here after move
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `orig`
