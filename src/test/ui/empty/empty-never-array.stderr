error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `Helper::T(_, _)` not covered

LL |     let Helper::U(u) = Helper::T(t, []);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^ pattern `Helper::T(_, _)` not covered
   |
   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html

   = note: the matched value is of type `Helper<T, U>`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched

help: alternatively, on nightly, you might want to use `#![feature(let_else)]` to handle the variant that isn't matched
