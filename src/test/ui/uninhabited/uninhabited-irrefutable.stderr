error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `Foo::A(_)` not covered

LL |     let Foo::D(_y, _z) = x;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ pattern `Foo::A(_)` not covered

   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant

   = note: the matched value is of type `Foo`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched

help: alternatively, on nightly, you might want to use `#![feature(let_else)]` to handle the variant that isn't matched
