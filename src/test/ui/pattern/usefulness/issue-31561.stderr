error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `Bar` and `Baz` not covered

   |           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ patterns `Bar` and `Baz` not covered
   |
   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html
   = note: the matched value is of type `Thing`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched

LL |     if let Thing::Foo(y) = Thing::Foo(1) { /* */ }
