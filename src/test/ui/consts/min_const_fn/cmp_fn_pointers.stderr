error[E0277]: can't compare `fn()` with `_` in const contexts

LL |     unsafe { x == y }
   |                ^^ no implementation for `fn() == _`

   = help: the trait `~const PartialEq<_>` is not implemented for `fn()`
note: the trait `PartialEq<_>` is implemented for `fn()`, but that implementation is not `const`
