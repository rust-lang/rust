   |          ^^^^^ the trait `std::marker::Copy` is not implemented for `U1`

error[E0599]: no method named `clone` found for union `U5<CloneNoCopy>` in the current scope

   = note: the method `clone` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `U5<CloneNoCopy> : std::clone::Clone`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `std::clone::Clone`
