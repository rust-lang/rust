error[E0277]: the trait bound `U1: std::marker::Copy` is not satisfied

LL | #[derive(Clone)]
   |          ^^^^^ the trait `std::marker::Copy` is not implemented for `U1`

   = note: required by `std::clone::AssertParamIsCopy`

error[E0599]: no method named `clone` found for type `U4<CloneNoCopy>` in the current scope

   = note: the method `clone` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `U4<CloneNoCopy> : std::clone::Clone`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `std::clone::Clone`
