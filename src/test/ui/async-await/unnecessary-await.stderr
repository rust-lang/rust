   = help: the trait `Future` is not implemented for `()`
   = note: () must be a future or must implement `IntoFuture` to be awaited
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `IntoFuture` for `()`
help: remove the `.await`

help: alternatively, consider making `fn boo` asynchronous
