error[E0277]: future cannot be sent between threads safely

   |     ^^^^^^^ future returned by `foo` is not `Send`

   = help: within `impl std::future::Future`, the trait `std::marker::Send` is not implemented for `std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, u32>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

   |     --------------------^^^^^^- `bar(&Mutex::new(22))` is later dropped here

   |     await occurs here, with `bar(&Mutex::new(22))` maybe used later
   |     has type `impl std::future::Future`
   = note: required because it appears within the type `impl std::future::Future`
