error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `self`, which is owned by the current function

LL |         foo(|| self.bar()).await;
   |             ^^ ---- `self` is borrowed here
   |             |

note: function requires argument type to outlive `'static`

LL |         foo(|| self.bar()).await;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: to force the closure to take ownership of `self` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
   |
LL |         foo(move || self.bar()).await;
