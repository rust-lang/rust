error[E0373]: async block may outlive the current function, but it borrows `room_ref`, which is owned by the current function

   = note: async blocks are not executed immediately and must either take a reference or ownership of outside variables they use
help: to force the async block to take ownership of `room_ref` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword

LL |         game_loop(Arc::clone(&room_ref))
