error[E0277]: the size for values of type `T` cannot be known at compilation time

LL | struct Foo<T> { data: T }
   |            - required by this bound in `Foo`
LL | fn foo1<T>() { not_sized::<Foo<T>>() } // Hunky dory.
LL | fn foo2<T: ?Sized>() { not_sized::<Foo<T>>() }
   |         -                          ^^^^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |         |
   |         this type parameter needs to be `std::marker::Sized`

help: you could relax the implicit `Sized` bound on `T` if it were used through indirection like `&T` or `Box<T>`

LL | struct Foo<T> { data: T }
   |            ^          - ...if indirection were used here: `Box<T>`
   |            |
   |            this could be changed to `T: ?Sized`...

   = note: required because it appears within the type `Bar<T>`
