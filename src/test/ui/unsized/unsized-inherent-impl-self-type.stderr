error[E0277]: the size for values of type `X` cannot be known at compilation time

help: you could relax the implicit `Sized` bound on `Y` if it were used through indirection like `&Y` or `Box<Y>`

LL | struct S5<Y>(Y);
   |           ^  - ...if indirection were used here: `Box<Y>`
   |           |
   |           this could be changed to `Y: ?Sized`...
