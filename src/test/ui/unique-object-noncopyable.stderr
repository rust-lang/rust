   = note: the method `clone` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `std::boxed::Box<dyn Foo> : std::clone::Clone`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `std::clone::Clone`
