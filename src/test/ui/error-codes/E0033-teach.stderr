note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL |     fn foo();

help: consider turning `foo` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument

help: alternatively, consider constraining `foo` so it does not apply to trait objects

error[E0033]: type `&dyn SomeTrait` cannot be dereferenced

   = note: This error indicates that a pointer to a trait type cannot be implicitly dereferenced by a pattern. Every trait defines a type, but because the size of trait implementors isn't fixed, this type has no compile-time size. Therefore, all accesses to trait types must be through pointers. If you encounter this error you should try to avoid dereferencing the pointer.
           
           You can read more about trait objects in the Trait Objects section of the Reference: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types.html#trait-objects
