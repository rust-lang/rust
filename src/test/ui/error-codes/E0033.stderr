note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL |     fn foo();

help: consider turning `foo` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument

help: alternatively, consider constraining `foo` so it does not apply to trait objects
