error[E0508]: cannot move out of type `[NonCopy; 1]`, a non-copy array
  --> $DIR/E0508-fail.rs:5:18

   |                  cannot move out of here
   |                  move occurs because `array[_]` has type `NonCopy`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |                  help: consider borrowing here: `&array[0]`
