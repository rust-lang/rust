error[E0495]: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for lifetime parameter `'a` due to conflicting requirements

note: first, the lifetime cannot outlive the lifetime 'a as defined on the function body at 22:8...

note: ...but the lifetime must also be valid for the lifetime 'b as defined on the function body at 22:12...

           expected Project<'a, 'b>
              found Project<'_, '_>
