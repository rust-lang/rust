error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `Err(_)` not covered

   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant

help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched

help: alternatively, you might want to use let else to handle the variant that isn't matched
