   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html
   = note: the matched value is of type `Result<u32, &R>`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched
