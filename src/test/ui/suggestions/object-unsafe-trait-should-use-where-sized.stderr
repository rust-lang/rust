error[E0038]: the trait `Trait` cannot be made into an object

   |           ^^^^^^^^^^ `Trait` cannot be made into an object

note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>
