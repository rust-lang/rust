LL |     println!("{}", path);
   |                    ^^^^ `Path` cannot be formatted with the default formatter; call `.display()` on it
   |
   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Path`
   = note: call `.display()` or `.to_string_lossy()` to safely print paths, as they may contain non-Unicode data
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
