error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`
  --> $DIR/issue-26046-fn-once.rs:14:19
   |
14 |     let closure = move || { //~ ERROR expected a closure
   |                   ^^^^^^^ this closure implements `FnOnce`, not `Fn`
15 |         vec
   |         --- closure is `FnOnce` because it moves the variable `vec` out of its environment
...
18 |     Box::new(closure)
   |     ----------------- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here

error: aborting due to previous error
