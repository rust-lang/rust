error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*rofl` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference

LL |     rofl.push(Vec::new());
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `rofl` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable

error[E0594]: cannot assign to `*r`, which is behind a `&` reference

LL |     *r = 0;
   |     ^^^^^^ `r` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be written

LL |     *x = 1;
   |     ^^^^^^ `x` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be written
