error[E0507]: cannot move out of `foo` in pattern guard
  --> $DIR/issue-27282-mutation-in-guard.rs:6:18

LL |                 (|| { let bar = foo; bar.take() })();
   |                  ^^             ---
   |                  |              |
   |                  |              move occurs because `foo` has type `&mut Option<&i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |                  |              move occurs due to use in closure
   |                  move out of `foo` occurs here
   |
   = note: variables bound in patterns cannot be moved from until after the end of the pattern guard
