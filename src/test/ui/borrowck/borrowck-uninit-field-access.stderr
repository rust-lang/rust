error[E0382]: use of moved value: `line1.origin`

   |
   = note: move occurs because `line1.origin` has type `Point`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

LL |     line2.consume();
   |     ^^^^^ value used here after partial move

   = note: move occurs because `line2.middle` has type `Point`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
