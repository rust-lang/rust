14 | fn foo(_x: K) {} //~ ERROR: `I + 'static: std::marker::Sized` is not satisfied
   |        ^^ the trait `std::marker::Sized` is not implemented for `I + 'static`
   |
   = note: `I + 'static` does not have a constant size known at compile-time
   = note: all local variables must have a statically known size

error: aborting due to previous error
