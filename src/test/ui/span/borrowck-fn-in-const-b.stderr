error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*x` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference

   |                  ------------ help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut Vec<String>`
LL |         x.push(format!("this is broken"));
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `x` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
