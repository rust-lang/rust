error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*x` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference

LL | fn borrowed_receiver(x: &dyn Foo) {
   |                         -------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut dyn Foo`

LL |     x.borrowed_mut();
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `x` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
