   = note: did you intend to capture a variable `x` from the surrounding scope?
   = note: to avoid ambiguity, `format_args!` cannot capture variables when the format string is expanded from a macro
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::concat` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
