// Regression test for #47244: in this specific scenario, when the
// expected type indicated 1 argument but the closure takes two, we
// would (early on) create type variables for the type of `b`. If the
// user then attempts to invoke a method on `b`, we would get an error
// saying that the type of `b` must be known, which was not very
// helpful.
