LL |     let s = CString::new("some text").unwrap().as_ptr();
   |             ---------------------------------- ^^^^^^ this pointer will be invalid
   |             |
   |             this `CString` is deallocated at the end of the expression, bind it to a variable to extend its lifetime

LL | #![deny(temporary_cstring_as_ptr)]
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = note: pointers do not have a lifetime; when calling `as_ptr` the `CString` is deallocated because nothing is referencing it as far as the type system is concerned

error: aborting due to previous error
