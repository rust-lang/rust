error: getting the inner pointer of a temporary `CString`

   |                   ------------------------- ^^^^^^ this pointer will be invalid
   |                   |
   |                   this `CString` is deallocated at the end of the statement, bind it to a variable to extend its lifetime

LL | #![deny(temporary_cstring_as_ptr)]
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = note: pointers do not have a lifetime; when calling `as_ptr` the `CString` will be deallocated at the end of the statement because nothing is referencing it as far as the type system is concerned
   = help: for more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/destructors.html
