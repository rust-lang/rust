LL | type Unused = u8;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Unused`

   = note: the leading underscore signals that this type alias serves some other purpose
           even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect.
note: the lint level is defined here
