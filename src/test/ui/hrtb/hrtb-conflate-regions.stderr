error: implementation of `Foo` is not general enough

   = note: Due to a where-clause on `want_foo2`,
   = note: `SomeStruct` must implement `Foo<(&'0 isize, &'1 isize)>`, for any two lifetimes `'0` and `'1`
   = note: but `SomeStruct` actually implements `Foo<(&'2 isize, &'2 isize)>`, for some specific lifetime `'2`

error: aborting due to previous error
