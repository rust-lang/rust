error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: ~const Foo` is not satisfied

LL | impl const Bar for S {}
   |            ^^^ the trait `~const Foo` is not implemented for `S`

note: the trait `Foo` is implemented for `S`, but that implementation is not `const`

note: required by a bound in `Bar`

LL | trait Bar: ~const Foo {}
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `Bar`
help: consider introducing a `where` clause, but there might be an alternative better way to express this requirement
