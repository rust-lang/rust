   |           ^^^^ cannot move out of borrowed content
LL |         &E::Foo => {}
LL |         &E::Bar(identifier) => f(identifier.clone())
   |         -------------------
   |         |       |
   |         |       data moved here
   |         help: consider removing the `&`: `E::Bar(identifier)`
   |
note: move occurs because `identifier` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
