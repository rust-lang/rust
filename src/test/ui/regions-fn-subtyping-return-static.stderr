51 |     want_F(bar); //~ ERROR E0308
   |            ^^^ expected concrete lifetime, found bound lifetime parameter 'cx
   |
   = note: expected type `fn(&'cx S) -> &'cx S`
              found type `fn(&'a S) -> &S {bar::<'_>}`
   = note: lifetime parameter `'b` declared on fn `bar` appears only in the return type, but here is required to be higher-ranked, which means that `'b` must appear in both argument and return types
   = note: this error is the result of a recent bug fix; for more information, see issue #33685 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33685>

error: aborting due to previous error
