LL |     pub fn foo(self) -> isize {
   |                ---- move occurs because `self` has type `S`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |         self.bar();
   |              ----- `self` moved due to this method call
LL |         return *self.x;
   |                ^^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `self`
