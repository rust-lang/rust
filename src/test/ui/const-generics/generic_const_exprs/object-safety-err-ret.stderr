error[E0038]: the trait `Foo` cannot be made into an object

   |                ^^^^^^^ `Foo` cannot be made into an object
   |
note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL |     fn test(&self) -> [u8; bar::<Self>()];
   |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...because method `test` references the `Self` type in its return type
   = help: consider moving `test` to another trait
