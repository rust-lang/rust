//! A pointer type for heap allocation.
//!
//! `Box<T>`, casually referred to as a 'box', provides the simplest form of
//! heap allocation in Rust. Boxes provide ownership for this allocation, and
//! drop their contents when they go out of scope.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Move a value from the stack to the heap by creating a [`Box`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let val: u8 = 5;
//! let boxed: Box<u8> = Box::new(val);
//! ```
//!
//! Move a value from a [`Box`] back to the stack by [dereferencing]:
//!
//! ```
//! let boxed: Box<u8> = Box::new(5);
//! let val: u8 = *boxed;
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a recursive data structure:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! enum List<T> {
//!     Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
//!     Nil,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let list: List<i32> = List::Cons(1, Box::new(List::Cons(2, Box::new(List::Nil))));
//!     println!("{:?}", list);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This will print `Cons(1, Cons(2, Nil))`.
//!
//! Recursive structures must be boxed, because if the definition of `Cons`
//! looked like this:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0072
//! # enum List<T> {
//! Cons(T, List<T>),
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! It wouldn't work. This is because the size of a `List` depends on how many
//! elements are in the list, and so we don't know how much memory to allocate
//! for a `Cons`. By introducing a `Box`, which has a defined size, we know how
//! big `Cons` needs to be.
//!
//! # Memory layout
//!
//! For non-zero-sized values, a [`Box`] will use the [`Global`] allocator for
//! its allocation. It is valid to convert both ways between a [`Box`] and a
//! raw pointer allocated with the [`Global`] allocator, given that the
//! [`Layout`] used with the allocator is correct for the type. More precisely,
//! a `value: *mut T` that has been allocated with the [`Global`] allocator
//! with `Layout::for_value(&*value)` may be converted into a box using
//! `Box::<T>::from_raw(value)`. Conversely, the memory backing a `value: *mut
//! T` obtained from `Box::<T>::into_raw` may be deallocated using the
//! [`Global`] allocator with `Layout::for_value(&*value)`.
//!

/* Nota bene
 *
 *  We could have chosen not to add this impl, and instead have written a
 *  function of Pin<Box<T>> to Pin<T>. Such a function would not be sound,
 *  because Box<T> implements Unpin even when T does not, as a result of
 *  this impl.
 *
 *  We chose this API instead of the alternative for a few reasons:
 *      - Logically, it is helpful to understand pinning in regard to the
 *        memory region being pointed to. For this reason none of the
 *        standard library pointer types support projecting through a pin
 *        (Box<T> is the only pointer type in std for which this would be
 *        safe.)
 *      - It is in practice very useful to have Box<T> be unconditionally
 *        Unpin because of trait objects, for which the structural auto
 *        trait functionality does not apply (e.g., Box<dyn Foo> would
 *        otherwise not be Unpin).
 *
 *  Another type with the same semantics as Box but only a conditional
 *  implementation of `Unpin` (where `T: Unpin`) would be valid/safe, and
 *  could have a method to project a Pin<T> from it.
