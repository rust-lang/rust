* The libuv asynchronous I/O library. Code for this package
  is found in the src/rt/libuv directory, within this
  distribution. This package is redistributed under the
  following terms, as noted in its source:

    Copyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors. All
    rights reserved.  Permission is hereby granted, free of
    charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software
    and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to
    deal in the Software without restriction, including
    without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify,
    merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom
    the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the
    following conditions:

    The above copyright notice and this permission notice
    shall be included in all copies or substantial portions
    of the Software.

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
    ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT
    SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
    CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
    OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR
    IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
    DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.


* Additional libraries included in libuv carry separate
  BSD-compatible licenses. See src/rt/libuv/LICENSE for
  details.


* Additional copyright may be retained by contributors other
  than Mozilla or the parties enumerated in this file. Such
  copyright can be determined on a case-by-case basis by
  examining the author of each portion of a file in the
  revision-control commit records of the project, or by
  consulting representative comments claiming copyright
  ownership for a file.

   For example, the text:

      "Copyright (c) 2011 Google Inc."

   appears in some files, and these files thereby denote
   that their author and copyright-holder is Google Inc.

   In all such cases, the absence of explicit licensing text
   indicates that the contributor chose to license their
   work for distribution under identical terms to those
   Mozilla has chosen for the collective work, enumerated
   below.  The only difference is the retention of copyright
   itself, held by the contributor.
