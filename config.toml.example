# Sample TOML configuration file for building Rust.
#
# To configure rustbuild, copy this file to the directory from which you will be
# running the build, and name it config.toml.
#
# All options are commented out by default in this file, and they're commented
# out with their default values. The build system by default looks for
# `config.toml` in the current directory of a build for build configuration, but
# a custom configuration file can also be specified with `--config` to the build
# system.
