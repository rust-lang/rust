# out with their default values. The build system by default looks for
# `config.toml` in the current directory of a build for build configuration, but
# a custom configuration file can also be specified with `--config` to the build
# system.

# Keeps track of the last version of `x.py` used.
# If it does not match the version that is currently running,
# `x.py` will prompt you to update it and read the changelog.
# See `src/bootstrap/CHANGELOG.md` for more information.

# building without optimizations takes much longer than optimizing. Further, some platforms
# fail to build without this optimization (c.f. #65352).
#optimize = true

# Indicates that the build should be configured for debugging Rust. A
# `debug`-enabled compiler and standard library will be somewhat
# slower (due to e.g. checking of debug assertions) but should remain
# usable.
#
# Note: If this value is set to `true`, it will affect a number of
#       configuration options below as well, if they have been left
#       unconfigured in this file.
#
# Note: changes to the `debug` setting do *not* affect `optimize`
#       above. In theory, a "maximally debuggable" environment would
#       set `optimize` to `false` above to assist the introspection
#       facilities of debuggers like lldb and gdb. To recreate such an
#       environment, explicitly set `optimize` to `false` and `debug`
#       to `true`. In practice, everyone leaves `optimize` set to
#       `true`, because an unoptimized rustc with debugging
#       enabled becomes *unusably slow* (e.g. rust-lang/rust#24840
