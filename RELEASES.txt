Version 0.8 (October 2013)
--------------------------

   * ~2100 changes, numerous bugfixes

   * Language
      * The `for` loop syntax has changed to work with the `Iterator` trait.
      * At long last, unwinding works on Windows.
      * Default methods definitely mostly work.
      * Many trait inheritance bugs fixed.
      * Owned and borrowed trait objects work more reliably.
      * `copy` is no longer a keyword. It has been replaced by the `Clone` trait.
      * rustc can omit emission of code for the `debug!` macro if it is passed
        `--cfg ndebug`
      * mod.rs is now "blessed". When loading `mod foo;`, rustc will now look
        for foo.rs, then foo/mod.rs, and will generate an error when both are
        present.
      * Strings no longer contain trailing nulls. The new `std::c_str` module
        provides new mechanisms for converting to C strings.
      * The type of foreign functions is now `extern "C" fn` instead of `*u8'.
      * The FFI has been overhauled such that foreign functions are called directly,
        instead of through a stack-switching wrapper.
      * Calling a foreign function must be done through a Rust function with the
        `#[fixed_stack_segment]` attribute.
      * The `externfn!` macro can be used to declare both a foreign function and
        a `#[fixed_stack_segment]` wrapper at once.
      * `pub` and `priv` modifiers on `extern` blocks are no longer parsed.
      * `unsafe` is no longer allowed on extern fns - they are all unsafe.
      * `priv` is disallowed everywhere except for struct fields and enum variants.
      * `&T` (besides `&'static T`) is no longer allowed in `@T`.
      * `ref` bindings in irrefutable patterns work correctly now.
      * `char` is now prevented from containing invalid code points.
      * Casting to `bool` is no longer allowed.
      * `yield` is a reserved keyword.
      * `typeof` is a reserved keyword.
      * Crates may be imported by URL with `extern mod foo = "url";`.
      * Explicit enum discriminants may be given as uints as in `enum E { V = 0u }`
      * Static vectors can be initialized with repeating elements,
        e.g. `static foo: [u8, .. 100]: [0, .. 100];`.
      * Static structs can be initialized with functional record update,
        e.g. `static foo: Foo = Foo { a: 5, .. bar };`.
      * `cfg!` can be used to conditionally execute code based on the crate
        configuration, similarly to `#[cfg(...)]`.
      * The `unnecessary_qualification` lint detects unneeded module
        prefixes (default: allow).
      * Arithmetic operations have been implemented on the SIMD types in
        `std::unstable::simd`.
      * Exchange allocation headers were removed, reducing memory usage.
      * `format!` implements a completely new, extensible, and higher-performance
        string formatting system. It will replace `fmt!`.
      * `print!` and `println!` write formatted strings (using the `format!`
        extension) to stdout.
      * `write!` and `writeln!` write formatted strings (using the `format!`
        extension) to the new Writers in `std::rt::io`.
      * The library section in which a function or static is placed may
        be specified with `#[link_section = "..."]`.
      * The `proto!` syntax extension for defining bounded message protocols
        was removed.
      * `macro_rules!` is hygenic for `let` declarations.
      * The `#[export_name]` attribute specifies the name of a symbol.
      * `unreachable!` can be used to indicate unreachable code, and fails
        if executed.

   * Libraries
      * std: Transitioned to the new runtime, written in Rust.
      * std: Added an experimental I/O library, `rt::io`, based on the new
        runtime.
      * std: A new generic `range` function was added to the prelude, replacing
        `uint::range` and friends.
      * std: `range_rev` no longer exists. Since range is an iterator it can be
        reversed with `range(lo, hi).invert()`.
      * std: The `chain` method on option renamed to `and_then`; `unwrap_or_default`
        renamed to `unwrap_or`.
      * std: The `iterator` module was renamed to `iter`.
      * std: Integral types now support the `checked_add`, `checked_sub`, and
        `checked_mul` operations for detecting overflow.
      * std: Many methods in `str`, `vec`, `option, `result` were renamed for
        consistency.
      * std: Methods are standardizing on conventions for casting methods:
        `to_foo` for copying, `into_foo` for moving, `as_foo` for temporary
        and cheap casts.
      * std: The `CString` type in `c_str` provides new ways to convert to and
        from C strings.
      * std: `DoubleEndedIterator` can yield elements in two directions.
      * std: The `mut_split` method on vectors partitions an `&mut [T]` into
        two splices.
      * std: `str::from_bytes` renamed to `str::from_utf8`.
      * std: `pop_opt` and `shift_opt` methods added to vectors.
      * std: The task-local data interface no longer uses @, and keys are
        no longer function pointers.
      * std: The `swap_unwrap` method of `Option` renamed to `take_unwrap`.
      * std: Added `SharedPort` to `comm`.
      * std: `Eq` has a default method for `ne`; only `eq` is required
        in implementations.
      * std: `Ord` has default methods for `le`, `gt` and `le`; only `lt`
        is required in implementations.
      * std: `is_utf8` performance is improved, impacting many string functions.
      * std: `os::MemoryMap` provides cross-platform mmap.
      * std: `ptr::offset` is now unsafe, but also more optimized. Offsets that
        are not 'in-bounds' are considered undefined.
      * std: Many freestanding functions in `vec` removed in favor of methods.
      * std: Many freestanding functions on scalar types removed in favor of
        methods.
      * std: Many options to task builders were removed since they don't make
        sense in the new scheduler design.
      * std: More containers implement `FromIterator` so can be created by the
        `collect` method.
      * std: More complete atomic types in `unstable::atomics`.
      * std: `comm::PortSet` removed.
      * std: Mutating methods in the `Set` and `Map` traits have been moved into
        the `MutableSet` and `MutableMap` traits. `Container::is_empty`,
        `Map::contains_key`, `MutableMap::insert`, and `MutableMap::remove` have
        default implementations.
      * extra: `dlist`, the doubly-linked list was modernized.
      * extra: Added a `hex` module with `ToHex` and `FromHex` traits.
      * extra: Added `glob` module, replacing `std::os::glob`.
      * extra: `rope` was removed.
      * extra: `deque` was renamed to `ringbuf`. `RingBuf` implements `Deque`.
      * extra: `net`, and `timer` were removed. The experimental replacements
        are `std::rt::io::net` and `std::rt::io::timer`.
      * extra: Iterators implemented for `SmallIntMap`.
      * extra: Iterators implemented for `Bitv` and `BitvSet`.
      * extra: `SmallIntSet` removed. Use `BitvSet`.
      * extra: Performance of JSON parsing greatly improved.
      * extra: `semver` updated to SemVer 2.0.0.
      * extra: `term` handles more terminals correctly.
      * extra: `dbg` module removed.

   * Other
      * rustc's debug info generation (`-Z debug-info`) is greatly improved.
      * rustc accepts `--target-cpu` to compile to a specific CPU architecture,
        similarly to gcc's `--march` flag.
      * rustpkg has received many improvements.
      * rustpkg supports git tags as package IDs.
      * rustpkg builds into target-specific directories so it can be used for
        cross-compiling.
      * The number of concurrent test tasks is controlled by the environment
        variable RUST_TEST_TASKS.
      * The test harness can now report metrics for benchmarks.
      * All tools have man pages.
      * Programs compiled with `--test` now support the `-h` and `--help` flags.
      * The runtime uses jemalloc for allocations.
      * Segmented stacks are temporarily disabled as part of the transition to
        the new runtime. Stack overflows are possible!

Version 0.7 (July 2013)
-----------------------

      * Overloadable compound operators (`+=`, etc.) have been temporarily
        removed due to bugs.
      * The `for` loop protocol now requires `for`-iterators to return `bool`
        so they compose better.
      * The `Durable` trait is replaced with the `'static` bounds.
      * Trait default methods work more often.
      * Structs with the `#[packed]` attribute have byte alignment and

      * The `main` function is only detected at the topmost level of the crate.
        The `#[main]` attribute is still valid anywhere.

      * The `#[no_send]` attribute makes a type that would otherwise be

        named (for example: `fn f(&self) { }`). Implicit self is deprecated.
