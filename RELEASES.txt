Version 0.7 (July 2013)
-----------------------

   * ??? changes, numerous bugfixes

   * Syntax changes
      * `use mod` is no longer valid.
      * `fail!` and `assert!` accept `~str`, `&'static str` or `fmt!`-style
        argument list.
      * `Encodable`, `Decodable`, `Ord`, `TotalOrd`, `TotalEq`, `DeepClone`,
        `Rand`, `Zero` and `ToStr` can all be automatically derived with
        `#[deriving(...)]`.
      * The `Durable` trait is replaced with the `'static` bounds.
      * At long last, 'argument modes' no longer exist.
      * The `bytes!` macro returns a vector of bytes for string, u8, char,
        and unsuffixed integer literals.
      * `#[static_assert]` makes compile-time assertions about static bools.

   * Semantic changes
      * The borrow checker has been rewritten with flow-sensitivity, fixing
        many bugs and inconveniences.
      * The `self` parameter no longer implicitly means `&'self self`,
        and can be explicitly marked with a lifetime.
      * Structs with the `#[packed]` attribute have byte alignment and
        no padding between fields.
      * The `for` loop protocol now requires `for`-iterators to return `bool`
        so they compose better.
      * `Option<~T>` is now represented as a nullable pointer.
      * `@mut` does dynamic borrow checks correctly.
      * Macros TODO
      * The `main` function is only detected at the topmost level of the crate.
        The `#[main]` attribute is still valid anywhere.
      * Struct fields may no longer be mutable. Use inherited mutability.
      * The `#[non_owned]` attribute makes a type that would otherwise be
        `Owned`, not. TODO this may change to non_send before 0.7
      * The `#[mutable]` attribute makes a type that would otherwise be
        `Const`, note. TODO this may change to non_freeze before 0.7
      * Unbounded recursion will abort the process after reaching the limit
        specified by the `RUST_MAX_STACK` environment variable (default: 1GB).
      * The `vecs_implicitly_copyable` lint mode has been removed. Vectors
        are never implicitly copyable.

        named (for example: `fn f(&self) { }`). Implicit self is deprecated.

        are distinguished by the lack of a `self` parameter
      * Replaced the `Durable` trait with the `'static` lifetime
      * The old closure type syntax with the trailing sigil has been
        removed in favor of the more consistent leading sigil

      * `Clone` implementations can be automatically generated with
        `#[deriving(Clone)]`

      * Fixed length vector types are now written as `[int, .. 3]`
        instead of `[int * 3]`.

      * The name of the main function can be customized using #[main]
      * The default type of an inferred closure is &fn instead of @fn
      * `use` statements may no longer be "chained" - they cannot import
        identifiers imported by previous `use` statements
      * `use` statements are crate relative, importing from the "top"
