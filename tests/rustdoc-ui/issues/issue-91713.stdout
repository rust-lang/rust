Available passes for running rustdoc:
check_doc_test_visibility - run various visibility-related lints on doctests
strip-aliased-non-local - strips all non-local private aliased items from the output
        strip-hidden - strips all `#[doc(hidden)]` items from the output
       strip-private - strips all private items from a crate which cannot be seen externally, implies strip-priv-imports
  strip-priv-imports - strips all private import statements (`use`, `extern crate`) from a crate
   propagate-doc-cfg - propagates `#[doc(cfg(...))]` to child items
 propagate-stability - propagates stability to child items
collect-intra-doc-links - resolves intra-doc links
 collect-trait-impls - retrieves trait impls for items in the crate
calculate-doc-coverage - counts the number of items with and without documentation
           run-lints - runs some of rustdoc's lints

Default passes for rustdoc:
 collect-trait-impls
check_doc_test_visibility
strip-aliased-non-local
        strip-hidden  (when not --document-hidden-items)
       strip-private  (when not --document-private-items)
  strip-priv-imports  (when --document-private-items)
collect-intra-doc-links
   propagate-doc-cfg
 propagate-stability
           run-lints

Passes run with `--show-coverage`:
        strip-hidden  (when not --document-hidden-items)
       strip-private  (when not --document-private-items)
calculate-doc-coverage
