error: redundant explicit link target

LL | /// [`Vfs`][crate::Vfs]
   |      -----  ^^^^^^^^^^ explicit target is redundant
   |      |
   |      because label contains path that resolves to same destination
   |
   = note: when a link's destination is not specified,
           the label is used to resolve intra-doc links
note: the lint level is defined here
