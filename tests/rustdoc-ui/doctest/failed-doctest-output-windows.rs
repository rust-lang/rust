// There's a parallel generic version of this test for non-windows platforms.

// Issue #51162: A failed doctest was not printing its stdout/stderr
// FIXME: if/when the output of the test harness can be tested on its own, this test should be
// adapted to use that, and that normalize line can go away

// doctest fails at runtime
