// This test ensures that if there is are any macro calls alongside a `main` function,
// it will indeed consider the `main` function as the program entry point and *won't*
// generate its own `main` function to wrap everything even though macro calls are
// valid in statement contexts, too, and could just as well expand to statements or
// expressions (we don't perform any macro expansion to find `main`, see also
// <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57415>).
//
// See <./main-alongside-stmts.rs> for comparison.

// We test the "same" thing twice: Once via `compile_fail` to more closely mirror the reported

// namely `println!(â€¦)` not being valid in item contexts.
