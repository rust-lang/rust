   |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Trait` is not implemented for `foo::Struct`

note: there are multiple different versions of crate `foo` in the dependency graph

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is the expected trait

   | --------------- this is the found trait
   = help: you can use `cargo tree` to explore your dependency tree
   = help: the trait `Trait` is implemented for `Struct`
note: required by a bound in `check_trait`
