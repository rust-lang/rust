   32|       |//      `panic_unwind.rs` and `try_error_result.rs`.
   33|       |//   2. This test confirms the coverage generated when a program includes `UnwindAction::Terminate`.
   34|       |//   3. The test does not invoke the abort. By executing to a successful completion, the coverage
   35|       |//      results show where the program did and did not execute.
   36|       |//   4. If the program actually aborted, the coverage counters would not be saved (which "works as
   37|       |//      intended"). Coverage results would show no executed coverage regions.
   38|       |//   6. If `should_abort` is `true` and the program aborts, the program exits with a `132` status
   39|       |//      (on Linux at least).

   43|       |Expect the following coverage results:
   44|       |
   45|       |```text
   46|       |    16|     11|    while countdown > 0 {
   47|       |    17|     10|        if countdown < 5 {
   48|       |    18|      4|            might_abort(false);
   49|       |    19|      6|        }
   50|       |```
   51|       |
   52|       |This is actually correct.
   53|       |
   54|       |The condition `countdown < 5` executed 10 times (10 loop iterations).
   55|       |
   56|       |It evaluated to `true` 4 times, and executed the `might_abort()` call.
   57|       |
   58|       |It skipped the body of the `might_abort()` call 6 times. If an `if` does not include an explicit
   59|       |`else`, the coverage implementation injects a counter, at the character immediately after the `if`s
   60|       |closing brace, to count the "implicit" `else`. This is the only way to capture the coverage of the
   61|       |non-true condition.
   62|       |
   63|       |As another example of why this is important, say the condition was `countdown < 50`, which is always
   64|       |`true`. In that case, we wouldn't have a test for what happens if `might_abort()` is not called.
   65|       |The closing brace would have a count of `0`, highlighting the missed coverage.
