   |                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `NotObjectSafe` cannot be made into an object

note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

   |       -------------                       ^^^^ ...because method `eq` references the `Self` type in this parameter

   |       this trait cannot be made into an object...
   = help: consider moving `eq` to another trait
