   = warning: the behavior may change in a future release
   = note: for more information, see issue #56105 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56105>
   = note: downstream crates may implement trait `FromWasmAbi` for type `&_`
   = note: this behavior recently changed as a result of a bug fix; see rust-lang/rust#56105 for details
