// Regression test for Issue 25199: Check that one cannot hide a
// destructor's access to borrowed data behind a boxed trait object.
//
// Prior to fixing Issue 25199, this example was able to be compiled
// with rustc, and thus when you ran it, you would see the `Drop` impl
// for `Test` accessing state that had already been dropping (which is
// marked explicitly here with checking code within the `Drop` impl
// for `VecHolder`, but in the general case could just do unsound
// things like accessing memory that has been freed).
//
// Note that I would have liked to encode my go-to example of cyclic
// structure that accesses its neighbors in drop (and thus is
// fundamentally unsound) via this trick, but the closest I was able
// to come was dropck_trait_cycle_checked.rs, which is not quite as
// "good" as this regression test because the encoding of that example
// was forced to attach a lifetime to the trait definition itself
// (`trait Obj<'a>`) while *this* example is solely
