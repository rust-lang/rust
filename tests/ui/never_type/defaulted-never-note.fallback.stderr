   = help: the trait `ImplementedForUnitButNotNever` is implemented for `()`
   = note: this error might have been caused by changes to Rust's type-inference algorithm (see issue #48950 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48950> for more information)
   = help: you might have intended to use the type `()` here instead
