error[E0277]: the trait bound `(): ~const Tr` is not satisfied in `fn(()) -> i32 {<() as Tr>::a}`

LL | const _: () = assert!(need_const_closure(Tr::a) == 42);
   |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ within `fn(()) -> i32 {<() as Tr>::a}`, the trait `~const Tr` is not implemented for `()`

note: the trait `Tr` is implemented for `()`, but that implementation is not `const`

   = note: required because it appears within the type `fn(()) -> i32 {<() as Tr>::a}`
