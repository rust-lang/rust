   = note: reference of mutable static is a hard error from 2024 edition
   = note: mutable statics can be written to by multiple threads: aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_ref)]` on by default
help: mutable references are dangerous since if there's any other pointer or reference used for that static while the reference lives, that's UB; use `addr_of_mut!` instead to create a raw pointer

   = note: `static` and `const` variables can refer to other `const` variables. A `const` variable, however, cannot refer to a `static` variable.
   = help: to fix this, the value can be extracted to a `const` and then used.
