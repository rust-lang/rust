error[E0764]: mutable borrows of temporaries that have their lifetime extended until the end of the program are not allowed
  --> $DIR/check-immutable-mut-slices.rs:3:37

LL | static TEST: &'static mut [isize] = &mut [];
   |                                     ^^^^^^^ this mutable borrow refers to such a temporary
   |
   = note: Temporaries in constants and statics can have their lifetime extended until the end of the program
   = note: To avoid accidentally creating global mutable state, such temporaries must be immutable
   = help: If you really want global mutable state, try replacing the temporary by an interior mutable `static` or a `static mut`
