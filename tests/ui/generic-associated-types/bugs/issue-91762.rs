// We almost certainly want this to pass, but
// it's particularly difficult currently, because we need a way of specifying
// that `<Self::Base as Functor>::With<T> = Self` without using that when we have
// a `U`. See `https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92728` for a (hacky)
// solution. This might be better to just wait for Chalk.
