error[E0521]: borrowed data escapes outside of function

   |                                 `iter` is a reference that is only valid in the function body

   |                 |
   |                 `iter` escapes the function body here
   |                 argument requires that `'1` must outlive `'static`
   |
   = note: requirement occurs because of a mutable reference to `Eat<&mut I, F>`
   = note: mutable references are invariant over their type parameter
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
   = note: due to current limitations in the borrow checker, this implies a `'static` lifetime
