LL |     tick();
   |     ------ `tick` moved due to this call
LL |     tick();
   |     ^^^^ value used here after move

note: closure cannot be invoked more than once because it moves the variable `counter` out of its environment

LL |     let tick = || mem::drop(counter);
   |                             ^^^^^^^
note: this value implements `FnOnce`, which causes it to be moved when called
