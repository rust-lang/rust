LL |     tick();

LL |     tick();
   |     ^^^^ value used here after move

note: closure cannot be invoked more than once because it moves the variable `counter` out of its environment

LL |     let tick = move || mem::drop(counter);

note: this value implements `FnOnce`, which causes it to be moved when called
