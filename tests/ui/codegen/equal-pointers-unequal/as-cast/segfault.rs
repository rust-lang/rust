    // If we got here, it means `i` was in bounds.
    // Now, two options are possible:
    // EITHER `i` is not 0 (as we have asserted above),
    // so the unwrap will panic, because only the 0-th element is `Some`
    // OR the assert lied, `i` *is* 0, and the `unwrap` will not panic.

    // If we got here, it means `i` *was* actually 0.
    // Let's ignore the fact that the assert has lied
    // and try to take a mutable reference to the 0-th element.
    // `borrow_mut` should panic, because we are sill holding on
    // to a shared `Ref` for the same `RefCell`.
    *arr[0].borrow_mut() = None;

    // But it doesn't panic!
    // We have successfully replaced `Some(Box)` with `None`,
    // while holding a shared reference to it.
    // No unsafe involved.

    // The `Box` has been deallocated by now, so this is a dangling reference!

    // The following might segfault. Or it might not.
    // Depends on the platform semantics
    // and whatever happened to the pointed-to memory after deallocation.
    // let u: u8 = *r;
    // println!("{u}");
