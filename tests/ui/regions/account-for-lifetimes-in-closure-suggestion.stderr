   |                      ^^^ this usage requires that `'1` must outlive `'2`
   |
   = note: requirement occurs because of the type `TwoThings<'_, '_>`, which makes the generic argument `'_` invariant
   = note: the struct `TwoThings<'a, 'b>` is invariant over the parameter `'a`
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
