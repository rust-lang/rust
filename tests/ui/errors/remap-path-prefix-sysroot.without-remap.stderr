error[E0507]: cannot move out of `self.thread` which is behind a mutable reference
  --> $DIR/remap-path-prefix-sysroot.rs:LL:COL

LL |         self.thread.join().unwrap();
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^ ------ `self.thread` moved due to this method call
   |         |
   |         move occurs because `self.thread` has type `JoinHandle<()>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: `JoinHandle::<T>::join` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `self.thread`
