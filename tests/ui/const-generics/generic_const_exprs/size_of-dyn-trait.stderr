error[E0277]: the size for values of type `dyn Trait` cannot be known at compilation time

   = help: the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `dyn Trait`

LL | struct A<T>(T)
   |          ^ required by the implicit `Sized` requirement on this type parameter in `A`
help: you could relax the implicit `Sized` bound on `T` if it were used through indirection like `&T` or `Box<T>`

   |          |
   |          this could be changed to `T: ?Sized`...
