LL | mod foo { pub struct bar; }

LL |     let bar = 5;
   |         ^^^   - this expression has type `{integer}`
   |         |
   |         expected integer, found `bar`
   |         `bar` is interpreted as a unit struct, not a new binding
   |         help: introduce a new binding instead: `other_bar`
