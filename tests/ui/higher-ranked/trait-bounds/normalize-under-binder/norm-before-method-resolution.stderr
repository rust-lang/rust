error[E0277]: the trait bound `for<'a> <_ as Trait<'a>>::Out: Copy` is not satisfied

LL |     let _: () = weird_bound();
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `for<'a> Copy` is not implemented for `<_ as Trait<'a>>::Out`

note: this is a known limitation of the trait solver that will be lifted in the future
