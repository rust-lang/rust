   = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `RefCell<isize>`
   = note: if you want to do aliasing and mutation between multiple threads, use `std::sync::RwLock` instead
   = note: required for `Unique<RefCell<isize>>` to implement `Sync`
note: required because it appears within the type `Box<RefCell<isize>>`
