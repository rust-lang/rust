   = note: this shared reference has lifetime `'static`, but if the static ever gets mutated, or a mutable reference is created, then any further use of this shared reference is Undefined Behavior
help: use `addr_of!` instead to create a raw pointer

   = note: mutable statics can be mutated by multiple threads: aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior
