//! Test for #145784. This tests three things:
//!
//! - In Rust 2024, temporary lifetime extension applies to block tail expressions, such that
//!   extending borrows and `super let`s in block tails are extended to outlive the result of the
//!   block.
//!
//! - Since `super let`'s initializer has the same temporary scope as the variable scope of its
//!   bindings, this means that lifetime extension can effectively see through `super let`.
//!
//! - In particular, the argument to `pin!` is an extending expression, and the argument of an
//!   extending `pin!` has an extended temporary scope. The lifetime of the argument, as well those
//!   of extending borrows and `super lets` within it, should match the result of the `pin!`,
//!   regardless of whether it itself is extended by a parent expression.
//!
//! For more information on temporary lifetime extension, see
//! https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/destructors.html#temporary-lifetime-extension
//!
//! For tests that `super let` initializers aren't temporary drop scopes, and tests for
//! lifetime-extended `super let`, see tests/ui/borrowck/super-let-lifetime-and-drop.rs
