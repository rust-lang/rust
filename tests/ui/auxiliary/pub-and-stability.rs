// This crate attempts to enumerate the various scenarios for how a
// type can define fields and methods with various visibilities and
// stabilities.
//
// The basic stability pattern in this file has four cases:
// 1. no stability attribute at all
// 2. a stable attribute (feature "unit_test")
// 3. an unstable attribute that unit test enables (feature "unstable_declared")
// 4. an unstable attribute that unit test fails to enable (feature "unstable_undeclared")
//
// This file also covers four kinds of visibility: private,
// pub(module), pub(crate), and pub.
//
// However, since stability attributes can only be observed in
// cross-crate linkage scenarios, there is little reason to take the
// cross-product (4 stability cases * 4 visibility cases), because the
// first three visibility cases cannot be accessed outside this crate,
// and therefore stability is only relevant when the visibility is pub
// to the whole universe.
//
// (The only reason to do so would be if one were worried about the
// compiler having some subtle bug where adding a stability attribute
// introduces a privacy violation. As a way to provide evidence that
// this is not occurring, I have put stability attributes on some
// non-pub fields, marked with SILLY below)
