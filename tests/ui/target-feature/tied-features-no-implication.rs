// Can't use `compile_error!` here without `core`/`std` but requiring these makes this test only
// work if you have libcore built in the sysroot for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Can't run this
// test on any aarch64 platform because they all have different default available features - as
// written, this test depends on `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` having -paca,-pacg by default.

// With +paca, this multiple definition doesn't cause an error because +paca hasn't implied
// +pacg. With +pacg, the multiple definition error is emitted (and the tied feature error would
// be).
