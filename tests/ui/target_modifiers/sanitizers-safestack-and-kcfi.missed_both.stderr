   = help: the `-Zsanitizer` flag modifies the ABI so Rust crates compiled with different values of this flag cannot be used together safely
   = note: unset `-Zsanitizer` in this crate is incompatible with `-Zsanitizer=safestack,kcfi` in dependency `safestack_and_kcfi`
   = help: set `-Zsanitizer=safestack,kcfi` in this crate or unset `-Zsanitizer` in `safestack_and_kcfi`
   = help: if you are sure this will not cause problems, you may use `-Cunsafe-allow-abi-mismatch=sanitizer` to silence this error
