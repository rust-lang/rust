error: future cannot be sent between threads safely

LL | pub fn foo() -> impl Future + Send {
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future created by async block is not `Send`
   |
   = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `(dyn Any + Send + 'static)`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

   |               ------ has type `&Client` which is not `Send`
LL |             200 => {
LL |                 get().await;
   |                       ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `client` maybe used later
...
LL |     }
   |     - `client` is later dropped here
help: consider moving this into a `let` binding to create a shorter lived borrow
