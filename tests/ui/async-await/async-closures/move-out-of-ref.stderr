error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*x` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/move-out-of-ref.rs:9:9

LL | fn hello(x: &Ty) {
   |             --- move occurs because `*x` has type `Ty`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let c = async || {
LL |         *x;
   |         ^^ `*x` is moved here

note: if `Ty` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value

LL | struct Ty;
   | ^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
