error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*x` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/move-out-of-ref.rs:11:9
   |
LL |         *x;
   |         ^^ move occurs because `*x` has type `Ty`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: if `Ty` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/move-out-of-ref.rs:7:1
   |
LL | struct Ty;
   | ^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
...
LL |         *x;
   |         -- you could clone this value
