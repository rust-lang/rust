error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/move-consuming-capture.rs:15:9
   |
LL |         let x = async move || {
   |             - move occurs because `x` has type `{async closure@$DIR/move-consuming-capture.rs:11:17: 11:30}`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
LL |         x().await;
   |         --- `x` moved due to this method call
LL |         x().await;
   |         ^ value used here after move
   |
note: `async_call_once` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `x`
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/ops/async_function.rs:LL:COL
help: you could `clone` the value and consume it, if the `NoCopy: Clone` trait bound could be satisfied
   |
LL |         x.clone()().await;
   |          ++++++++
help: consider annotating `NoCopy` with `#[derive(Clone)]`
   |
LL + #[derive(Clone)]
LL | struct NoCopy;
