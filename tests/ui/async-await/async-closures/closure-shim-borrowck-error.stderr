error[E0507]: cannot move out of `x` which is behind a mutable reference
  --> $DIR/closure-shim-borrowck-error.rs:12:18

LL |     needs_fn_mut(async || {
   |                  ^^^^^^^^ `x` is moved here
LL |
LL |         x.hello();
   |         -
   |         |
   |         variable moved due to use in coroutine
   |         move occurs because `x` has type `Ty`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: if `Ty` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/closure-shim-borrowck-error.rs:18:1
   |
LL |         x.hello();
   |         - you could clone this value
...
LL | struct Ty;
   | ^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
