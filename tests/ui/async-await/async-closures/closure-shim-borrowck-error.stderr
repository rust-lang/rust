error[E0507]: cannot move out of `x` which is behind a mutable reference
  --> $DIR/closure-shim-borrowck-error.rs:11:18

LL | fn hello(x: Ty) {
   |             -- move occurs because `x` has type `Ty`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     needs_fn_mut(async || {
   |                  ^^^^^^^^ `x` is moved here

LL |         x.hello();
   |         - variable moved due to use in coroutine

note: if `Ty` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value

...
LL | struct Ty;
   | ^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
