error[E0382]: use of moved value: `iter`

LL |     let iter = core::async_iter::from_iter(0..3);
   |         ---- move occurs because `iter` has type `FromIter<std::ops::Range<i32>>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

note: `into_async_iter` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `iter`

help: you can `clone` the value and consume it, but this might not be your desired behavior
