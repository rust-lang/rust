LL |     assert_send(agent.handle());
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future returned by `handle` is not `Send`
   |
   = help: within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<String>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

LL |         let mut info = self.info_result.clone();
   |             -------- has type `InfoResult` which is not `Send`

   |                                       ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `mut info` maybe used later
note: required by a bound in `assert_send`
