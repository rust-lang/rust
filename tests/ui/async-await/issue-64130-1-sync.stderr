   |             ^^^^^ future returned by `bar` is not `Sync`

help: within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `Foo`

LL | struct Foo;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^
note: future is not `Sync` as this value is used across an await

LL |     let x = Foo;
   |         - has type `Foo` which is not `Sync`
LL |     baz().await;
   |           ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `x` maybe used later
note: required by a bound in `is_sync`
