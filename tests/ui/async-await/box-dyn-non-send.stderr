   = help: within `{async block@$DIR/box-dyn-non-send.rs:7:14: 7:19}`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `*const ()`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

LL |         let non_send = null::<()>();
   |             -------- has type `*const ()` which is not `Send`
LL |         &non_send;
LL |         async {}.await
   |                  ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `non_send` maybe used later
   = note: required for the cast from `Box<{async block@$DIR/box-dyn-non-send.rs:7:14: 7:19}>` to `Box<dyn Send>`
