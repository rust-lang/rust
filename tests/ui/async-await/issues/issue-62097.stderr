error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `self`, which is owned by the current function
  --> $DIR/issue-62097.rs:13:13

LL |         foo(|| self.bar()).await;
   |             ^^ ---- `self` is borrowed here
   |             |
   |             may outlive borrowed value `self`

note: function requires argument type to outlive `'static`

LL |         foo(|| self.bar()).await;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: to force the closure to take ownership of `self` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
   |
LL |         foo(move || self.bar()).await;
