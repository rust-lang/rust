   = help: within `[async block@$DIR/issue-65436-raw-ptr-not-send.rs:17:17: 20:6]`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `*const u8`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

   |                 |                 await occurs here, with `std::ptr::null()` maybe used later

help: consider moving this into a `let` binding to create a shorter lived borrow
