LL |     is_send(foo());
   |             ^^^^^ future returned by `foo` is not `Send`

   = help: within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, u32>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

LL |     let g = x.lock().unwrap();
   |         - has type `std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, u32>` which is not `Send`
LL |     baz().await;
   |           ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `g` maybe used later
note: required by a bound in `is_send`
