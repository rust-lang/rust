error[E0277]: the trait bound `Foo: Qux` is not satisfied in `impl Future<Output = ()>`
  --> $DIR/issue-64130-3-other.rs:27:12
   |
LL | async fn bar() {
   |                - within this `impl Future<Output = ()>`
...
LL |     is_qux(bar());
   |            ^^^^^ within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Qux` is not implemented for `Foo`
   |
note: future does not implement `Qux` as this value is used across an await
  --> $DIR/issue-64130-3-other.rs:21:10
   |
LL |     let x = Box::new(Foo);
   |         - has type `Box<Foo>` which does not implement `Qux`
LL |     baz().await;
   |          ^^^^^^ await occurs here, with `x` maybe used later
LL | }
   | - `x` is later dropped here
note: required by a bound in `is_qux`

LL | fn is_qux<T: Qux>(t: T) {}
   |              ^^^ required by this bound in `is_qux`
