error[E0038]: the trait `AsyncTrait` is not dyn compatible

LL |     let x: &dyn AsyncTrait = &"hello, world!";

   |
note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

LL |     async fn async_dispatch(&self);
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...because method `async_dispatch` is `async`
   = help: consider moving `async_dispatch` to another trait
   = help: only type `&'static str` implements `AsyncTrait`; consider using it directly instead.
