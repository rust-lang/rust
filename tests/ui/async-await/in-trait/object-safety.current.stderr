error[E0038]: the trait `Foo` cannot be made into an object

note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

   = help: consider moving `foo` to another trait
