   = note: the matched value is of type `Option<NonExhaustiveEnum>`
   = note: `NonExhaustiveEnum` is marked as non-exhaustive, so a wildcard `_` is necessary to match exhaustively
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a wildcard pattern or an explicit pattern as shown
