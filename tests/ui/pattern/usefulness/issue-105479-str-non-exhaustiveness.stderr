error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `(&_, _)` not covered
  --> $DIR/issue-105479-str-non-exhaustiveness.rs:4:11
   |
LL |     match (a, b) {
   |           ^^^^^^ pattern `(&_, _)` not covered
   |
   = note: the matched value is of type `(&str, &str)`
   = note: `&str` cannot be matched exhaustively, so a wildcard `_` is necessary
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a wildcard pattern or an explicit pattern as shown
