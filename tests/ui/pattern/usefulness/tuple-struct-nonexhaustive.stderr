   = note: the matched value is of type `Foo`
   = note: `isize` does not have a fixed maximum value, so a wildcard `_` is necessary to match exhaustively
   = help: add `#![feature(precise_pointer_size_matching)]` to the crate attributes to enable precise `isize` matching
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a wildcard pattern or an explicit pattern as shown
