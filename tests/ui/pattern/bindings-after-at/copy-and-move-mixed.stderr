error[E0382]: use of partially moved value
  --> $DIR/copy-and-move-mixed.rs:12:9

LL |     let a @ NC(b, c @ NC(d, e)) = NC(C, NC(C, C));

   |         |
   |         value used here after partial move
   |
   = note: partial move occurs because value has type `NC<C, C>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
help: borrow this binding in the pattern to avoid moving the value
