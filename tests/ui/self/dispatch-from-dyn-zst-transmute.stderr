error[E0378]: implementing the `DispatchFromDyn` trait requires multiple coercions

   = note: the trait `DispatchFromDyn` may only be implemented for a coercion between structures with a single field being coerced
   = note: currently, 2 fields need coercions: `token` (`IsSendToken<T>` to `IsSendToken<U>`), `ptr` (`&'a T` to `&'a U`)
