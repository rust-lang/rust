LL |   extern "C" {
   |   ---------- `extern` blocks define existing foreign functions and functions inside of them cannot have a body

   | |        cannot have a body
LL | |         println!("");
LL | |     }
   | |_____- help: remove the invalid body: `;`

   = help: you might have meant to write a function accessible through FFI, which can be done by writing `extern fn` outside of the `extern` block
