   = help: the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `[usize]`
   = note: statics and constants must have a statically known size

error[E0133]: use of extern static is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block

   = note: extern statics are not controlled by the Rust type system: invalid data, aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior
