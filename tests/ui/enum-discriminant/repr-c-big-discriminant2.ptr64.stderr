   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #124403 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/124403>
   = note: `repr(C)` enums with big discriminants are non-portable, and their size in Rust might not match their size in C
   = help: use `repr($int_ty)` instead to explicitly set the size of this enum
note: the lint level is defined here
