LL |         1.query::<dyn ToString>("")
   |           --------------------- ^^ expected `dyn ToString`, found `&str`

   |           arguments to this method are incorrect

   = note: expected trait object `dyn ToString`
                 found reference `&'static str`
   = help: `&'static str` implements `ToString` so you could box the found value and coerce it to the trait object `Box<dyn ToString>`, you will have to change the expected type as well
