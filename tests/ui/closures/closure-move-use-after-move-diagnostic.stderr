error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/closure-move-use-after-move-diagnostic.rs:13:13
   |
LL |     let x = NoCopy;
   |         - move occurs because `x` has type `NoCopy`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |
LL |     let f = move || {
   |             ------- value moved into closure here
LL |
LL |         let y = x;
   |                 - variable moved due to use in closure
...
LL |     let z = x;
   |             ^ value used here after move

note: if `NoCopy` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value

LL | struct NoCopy;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
