error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`
  --> $DIR/closure-wrong-kind.rs:10:19

LL |     let closure = |_| foo(x);
   |                   ^^^     - closure is `FnOnce` because it moves the variable `x` out of its environment
   |                   |
   |                   this closure implements `FnOnce`, not `Fn`
LL |     bar(closure);
   |     --- ------- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
   |     |
   |     required by a bound introduced by this call

note: required by a bound in `bar`
  --> $DIR/closure-wrong-kind.rs:6:11

LL | fn bar<T: Fn(u32)>(_: T) {}
   |           ^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `bar`
