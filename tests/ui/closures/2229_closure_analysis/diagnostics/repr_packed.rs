// Given how the closure desugaring is implemented (at least at the time of writing this test),
// we don't need to truncate the captured path to a reference into a packed-struct if the field
// being referenced will be moved into the closure, since it's safe to move out a field from a
// packed-struct.
//
// However to avoid surprises for the user, or issues when the closure is
// inlined we will truncate the capture to access just the struct regardless of if the field
// might get moved into the closure.
//
// It is possible for someone to try writing the code that relies on the desugaring to create a ref
// into a packed-struct. Here we test that the compiler still detects that case.
