error[E0597]: `stmt` does not live long enough

   | |
   | `stmt` dropped here while still borrowed
   | ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the destructor for type `Map<Rows<'_>, {closure@$DIR/issue-54556-stephaneyfx.rs:28:14: 28:19}>`
   |
   = note: the temporary is part of an expression at the end of a block;
           consider forcing this temporary to be dropped sooner, before the block's local variables are dropped
help: for example, you could save the expression's value in a new local variable `x` and then make `x` be the expression at the end of the block
   |
LL |     let x = rows.map(|row| row).next(); x
