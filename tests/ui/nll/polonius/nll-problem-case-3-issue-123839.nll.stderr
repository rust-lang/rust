error[E0506]: cannot assign to `self.status` because it is borrowed

LL |     fn foo(self: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &str> {
   |                  - let's call the lifetime of this reference `'1`
LL |         self.bar()?; // rust reports this line conflicts with the next line
   |         -----------
   |         |
   |         `self.status` is borrowed here
   |         returning this value requires that `*self` is borrowed for `'1`
LL |         self.status = 1; // and this line is the victim
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `self.status` is assigned to here but it was already borrowed
