error[E0594]: cannot assign to `*my_ref`, which is behind a `&` reference
  --> $DIR/issue-51244.rs:3:5
   |
LL |     *my_ref = 0;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ `my_ref` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be written
   |
help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference
   |
LL |     let ref mut my_ref @ _ = 0;
