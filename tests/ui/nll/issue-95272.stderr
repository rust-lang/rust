   |             ^^^^^ assignment requires that `'a` must outlive `'b`
   |
   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b`
   = note: requirement occurs because of a function pointer to `check`
   = note: the function `check` is invariant over the parameter `'a`
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
