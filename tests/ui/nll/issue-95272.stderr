error: lifetime may not live long enough

   |     ^^^^^^^ argument requires that `'a` must outlive `'b`
   |
   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b`
   = note: requirement occurs because of the type `Cell<&()>`, which makes the generic argument `&()` invariant
   = note: the struct `Cell<T>` is invariant over the parameter `T`
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
