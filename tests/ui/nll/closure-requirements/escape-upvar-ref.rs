// Test closure that:
//
// - captures a variable `y` by reference
// - stores that reference to `y` into another, longer-lived place (`p`)
//
// Both of these are upvars of reference type (the capture of `y` is
// of type `&'a i32`, the capture of `p` is of type `&mut &'b
// i32`). The closure thus computes a relationship between `'a` and
// `'b`.  This relationship is propagated to the closure creator,
// which reports an error.
