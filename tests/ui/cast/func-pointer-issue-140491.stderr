error[E0605]: non-primitive cast: `&for<'a, 'b> fn(&'a Event<'b>) {my_fn}` as `&for<'a, 'b> fn(&'a Event<'b>)`

LL | ... = &my_fn as _;
   |       ^^^^^^^^^^^ an `as` expression can only be used to convert between primitive types or to coerce to a specific trait object
   |
   = note: casting reference expression `&my_fn` because `&` binds tighter than `as`
