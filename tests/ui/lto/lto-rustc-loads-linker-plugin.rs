// This test ensures that if a dependency was compiled with
// `-Clinker-plugin-lto` then we can compile with `-Clto` and still link against
// that upstream rlib. This should work because LTO implies we're not actually
// linking against upstream rlibs since we're generating the object code
// locally. This test will fail if rustc can't find bytecode in rlibs compiled
// with `-Clinker-plugin-lto`.
