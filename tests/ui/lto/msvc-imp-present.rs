// On MSVC we have a "hack" where we emit symbols that look like `_imp_$name`
// for all exported statics. This is done because we apply `dllimport` to all
// imported constants and this allows everything to actually link correctly.
//
// The ThinLTO passes aggressively remove symbols if they can, and this test
// asserts that the ThinLTO passes don't remove these compiler-generated
// `_imp_*` symbols. The external library that we link in here is compiled with
// ThinLTO and multiple codegen units and has a few exported constants. Note
// that we also namely compile the library as both a dylib and an rlib, but we
// link the rlib to ensure that we assert those generated symbols exist.
