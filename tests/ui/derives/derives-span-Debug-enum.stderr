   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Error`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `Error` or manually `impl Debug for Error`
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Debug` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `Error` with `#[derive(Debug)]`
