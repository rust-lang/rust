error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding
  --> $DIR/slice_pattern_syntax_problem1.rs:4:9

LL |     let [a @ 3.., b @ ..3, c @ 4..6, ..] = xs;

   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-02-refutability.html
   = note: the matched value is of type `[i32; 8]`
help: you might want to use `let else` to handle the variant that isn't matched
