error[E0793]: reference to field of packed struct is unaligned

   = note: this struct is at most 4-byte aligned, but the type of this field may require higher alignment
   = note: creating a misaligned reference is undefined behavior (even if that reference is never dereferenced)
   = help: copy the field contents to a local variable, or replace the reference with a raw pointer and use `read_unaligned`/`write_unaligned` (loads and stores via `*p` must be properly aligned even when using raw pointers)
