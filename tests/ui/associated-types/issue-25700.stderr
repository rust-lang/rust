error[E0382]: use of moved value: `t`
  --> $DIR/issue-25700.rs:13:10
   |
LL |     let t = S::<()>(None);
   |         - move occurs because `t` has type `S<()>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     drop(t);
   |          - value moved here
LL |     drop(t);
   |          ^ value used here after move

note: if `S<()>` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value

LL |     drop(t);
