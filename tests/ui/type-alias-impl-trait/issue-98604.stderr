  --> $DIR/issue-98604.rs:9:5

LL |     Box::new(test) as AsyncFnPtr;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = ()>>>`, found future
   |
   = note: required for the cast from `fn() -> impl Future<Output = ()> {test}` to the object type `dyn Fn() -> Pin<Box<(dyn Future<Output = ()> + 'static)>>`
