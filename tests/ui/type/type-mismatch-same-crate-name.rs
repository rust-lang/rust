// This tests the extra note reported when a type error deals with
// seemingly identical types.
// The main use case of this error is when there are two crates
// (generally different versions of the same crate) with the same name
// causing a type mismatch. Here, we simulate that error using block-scoped
// aliased `extern crate` declarations.
