error[E0659]: `Shadow` is ambiguous
  --> $DIR/shadow.rs:16:19
   |
LL |     use crate::b::Shadow as _; // Only imports the struct
   |                   ^^^^^^ ambiguous name
   |
   = note: ambiguous because of a conflict between a macro-expanded name and a less macro-expanded name from outer scope during import or macro resolution
note: `Shadow` could refer to the struct defined here

   = help: use `self::Shadow` to refer to this struct unambiguously
note: `Shadow` could also refer to the trait imported here

help: trait `Deref` which provides `deref` is implemented but not in scope; perhaps you want to import it
