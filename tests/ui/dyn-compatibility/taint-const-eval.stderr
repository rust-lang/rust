LL | static FOO: &(dyn Qux + Sync) = "desc";
   |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Qux` is not dyn compatible

note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

LL |     fn bar();
   |        ^^^ ...because associated function `bar` has no `self` parameter
help: consider turning `bar` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument

LL |     fn bar(&self);

help: alternatively, consider constraining `bar` so it does not apply to trait objects
