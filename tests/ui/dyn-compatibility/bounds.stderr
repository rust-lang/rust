note: for a trait to be "dyn-compatible" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL |     type U: PartialEq<Self>;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...because it uses `Self` as a type parameter
