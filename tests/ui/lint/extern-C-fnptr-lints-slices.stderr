error: `extern` callback uses type `&[u8]`, which is not FFI-safe

   = help: consider using a raw pointer to the slice's first element (and a length) instead
   = note: this reference to an unsized type contains metadata, which makes it incompatible with a C pointer
note: the lint level is defined here
