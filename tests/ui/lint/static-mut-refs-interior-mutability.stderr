   = note: shared references to mutable statics are dangerous; it's undefined behavior if the static is mutated or if a mutable reference is created for it while the shared reference lives
   = help: use a type that relies on "interior mutability" instead; to read more on this, visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/interior-mutability.html>
   = note: `#[deny(static_mut_refs)]` (part of `#[deny(rust_2024_compatibility)]`) on by default
help: this type already provides "interior mutability", so its binding doesn't need to be declared as mutable
