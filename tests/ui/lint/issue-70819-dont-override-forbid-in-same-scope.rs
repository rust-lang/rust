// This test is checking that you cannot override a `forbid` by adding in other
// attributes later in the same scope. (We already ensure that you cannot
// override it in nested scopes).

// If you turn off deduplicate diagnostics (which rustc turns on by default but
// compiletest turns off when it runs ui tests), then the errors are
// (unfortunately) repeated here because the checking is done as we read in the
// errors, and currently that happens two or three different times, depending on
// compiler flags.
//
// I decided avoiding the redundant output was not worth the time in engineering
// effort for bug like this, which 1. end users are unlikely to run into in the
// first place, and 2. they won't see the redundant output anyway.

//@ compile-flags: -Z deduplicate-diagnostics=yes
