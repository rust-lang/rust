   = note: the prefix `--` could be misinterpreted as a decrement operator which exists in other languages
   = note: use `-= 1` if you meant to decrement the value
   = note: `#[warn(double_negations)]` on by default
   = note: this warning originates in the macro `bad_macro` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
