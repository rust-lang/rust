   |
   = note: pointers do not have a lifetime; when calling `as_ptr` the `CString` will be deallocated at the end of the statement because nothing is referencing it as far as the type system is concerned

   = help: in particular, if this pointer is returned from the current function, binding the `CString` inside the function will not suffice
