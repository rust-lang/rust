LL |     is_send(foo::<T>());
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^ future returned by `foo` is not `Send`

   = help: within `impl Future<Output = Result<(), ()>>`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `impl Future<Output = Result<(), ()>> { <T as Foo>::method(..) }`
note: future is not `Send` as it awaits another future which is not `Send`

LL |     T::method().await?;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ await occurs here on type `impl Future<Output = Result<(), ()>> { <T as Foo>::method(..) }`, which is not `Send`
note: required by a bound in `is_send`

help: consider further restricting the associated type
