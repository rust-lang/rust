   = help: consider increasing the recursion limit by adding a `#![recursion_limit = "14"]` attribute to your crate (`recursive_const_in_impl`)
   = note: query depth increased by 9 when simplifying constant for the type system `main::promoted[1]`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
