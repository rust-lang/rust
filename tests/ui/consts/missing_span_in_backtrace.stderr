   = help: this code performed an operation that depends on the underlying bytes representing a pointer
   = help: the absolute address of a pointer is not known at compile-time, so such operations are not supported
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::intrinsics::const_eval_select` which comes from the expansion of the macro `const_eval_select` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
