//@revisions: string unit atomic
#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]

//! Check that we do not cause cycle errors when trying to
//! obtain information about interior mutability of an opaque type.
//! This used to happen, because when the body-analysis failed, we
//! checked the type instead, but the constant was also defining the
//! hidden type of the opaque type. Thus we ended up relying on the
//! result of our analysis to compute the result of our analysis.
