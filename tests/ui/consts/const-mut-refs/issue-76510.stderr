error[E0764]: mutable borrows of temporaries that have their lifetime extended until the end of the program are not allowed
  --> $DIR/issue-76510.rs:3:29
   |
LL | const S: &'static mut str = &mut " hello ";
   |                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this mutable borrow refers to such a temporary
   |
   = note: Temporaries in constants and statics can have their lifetime extended until the end of the program
   = note: To avoid accidentally creating global mutable state, such temporaries must be immutable
   = help: If you really want global mutable state, try replacing the temporary by an interior mutable `static` or a `static mut`
