error[E0764]: mutable borrows of temporaries that have their lifetime extended until the end of the program are not allowed
  --> $DIR/write_to_static_via_mut_ref.rs:1:26
   |
LL | static OH_NO: &mut i32 = &mut 42;
   |                          ^^^^^^^ this mutable borrow refers to such a temporary
   |
   = note: Temporaries in constants and statics can have their lifetime extended until the end of the program
   = note: To avoid accidentally creating global mutable state, such temporaries must be immutable
   = help: If you really want global mutable state, try replacing the temporary by an interior mutable `static` or a `static mut`

error[E0594]: cannot assign to `*OH_NO`, as `OH_NO` is an immutable static item
  --> $DIR/write_to_static_via_mut_ref.rs:4:5
   |
LL |     *OH_NO = 43;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot assign
