error[E0015]: cannot call non-const fn `Y::foo` in statics
  --> $DIR/issue-16538.rs:11:23

LL | static foo: &Y::X = &*Y::foo(Y::x as *const Y::X);
   |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   = note: calls in statics are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants
   = note: consider wrapping this expression in `std::sync::LazyLock::new(|| ...)`

error[E0133]: dereference of raw pointer is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block
  --> $DIR/issue-16538.rs:11:22

LL | static foo: &Y::X = &*Y::foo(Y::x as *const Y::X);
   |                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ dereference of raw pointer
   |
   = note: raw pointers may be null, dangling or unaligned; they can violate aliasing rules and cause data races: all of these are undefined behavior

error[E0133]: use of extern static is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block
  --> $DIR/issue-16538.rs:11:30

LL | static foo: &Y::X = &*Y::foo(Y::x as *const Y::X);

   |
   = note: extern statics are not controlled by the Rust type system: invalid data, aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior
