error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `&[]` and `&[_, _, ..]` not covered

LL |         E_SL => {}
   |         ---- this pattern doesn't introduce a new catch-all binding, but rather pattern matches against the value of constant `E_SL`

   = note: the matched value is of type `&[E]`
note: constant `E_SL` defined here

LL | const E_SL: &[E] = &[E::A];
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: if you meant to introduce a binding, use a different name

LL |         E_SL_var => {}
   |             ++++
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a wildcard pattern, a match arm with multiple or-patterns as shown, or multiple match arms
