LL |     &{a.0}
   |     ^^^^^^ this borrow of an interior mutable value refers to such a temporary
   |
   = note: Temporaries in constants and statics can have their lifetime extended until the end of the program
   = note: To avoid accidentally creating global mutable state, such temporaries must be immutable
   = help: If you really want global mutable state, try replacing the temporary by an interior mutable `static` or a `static mut`
