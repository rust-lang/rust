error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*inbounds` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/issue-102389.rs:4:11
   |
LL |     array[*inbounds as usize]
   |           ^^^^^^^^^ move occurs because `*inbounds` has type `Enum`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: if `Enum` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/issue-102389.rs:1:1
   |
LL | enum Enum { A, B, C }
   | ^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
...
LL |     array[*inbounds as usize]
   |           --------- you could clone this value
