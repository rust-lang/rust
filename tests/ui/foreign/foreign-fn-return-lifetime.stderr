error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier

LL |     pub fn f() -> &u8;

   = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from
help: consider using the `'static` lifetime, but this is uncommon unless you're returning a borrowed value from a `const` or a `static`

LL |     pub fn f() -> &'static u8;

help: instead, you are more likely to want to return an owned value
