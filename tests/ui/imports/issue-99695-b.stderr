error[E0432]: unresolved import `self::p::nu`

LL |     pub use self::p::{nu, other_item as _};
   |                       ^^ no `nu` in `m::p`
   |
   = note: this could be because a macro annotated with `#[macro_export]` will be exported at the root of the crate instead of the module where it is defined
help: a macro with this name exists at the root of the crate
