error[E0659]: `panic` is ambiguous
  --> $DIR/ambiguous-panic-no-implicit-prelude.rs:15:5
   |
LL |     panic!();
   |     ^^^^^ ambiguous name
   |
   = note: ambiguous because of a conflict between a name from a glob import and an outer scope during import or macro resolution
note: `panic` could refer to the macro imported here
  --> $DIR/ambiguous-panic-no-implicit-prelude.rs:14:9
   |
LL |     use m1::*;
   |         ^^^^^
   = help: consider adding an explicit import of `panic` to disambiguate
note: `panic` could also refer to a macro from prelude
