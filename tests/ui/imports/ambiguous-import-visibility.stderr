   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #149145 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/149145>
   = note: ambiguous because of a conflict between a name from a glob import and an outer scope during import or macro resolution
note: `RustEmbed` could refer to the derive macro imported here

   = help: consider adding an explicit import of `RustEmbed` to disambiguate
   = help: or use `crate::RustEmbed` to refer to this derive macro unambiguously
note: `RustEmbed` could also refer to the derive macro imported here
