Future incompatibility report: Future breakage diagnostic:
warning: `generic` is ambiguous

LL |     ambiguous_reachable_extern::generic::<u8>();
   |                                 ^^^^^^^ ambiguous name
   |
   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #114095 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114095>
   = note: ambiguous because of multiple glob imports of a name in the same module
note: `generic` could refer to the function defined here
  --> $DIR/auxiliary/ambiguous-reachable-extern.rs:13:9

LL | pub use m1::*;
   |         ^^
   = help: consider updating this dependency to resolve this error
   = help: if updating the dependency does not resolve the problem report the problem to the author of the relevant crate
note: `generic` could also refer to the function defined here
