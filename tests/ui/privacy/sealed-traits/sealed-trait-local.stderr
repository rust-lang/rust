error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: Hidden` is not satisfied

LL | impl a::Sealed for S {}
   |                    ^ the trait `Hidden` is not implemented for `S`

   = note: `Sealed` is a "sealed trait", because to implement it you also need to implelement `a::b::Hidden`, which is not accessible; this is usually done to force you to use one of the provided types that already implement it
