error[E0382]: use of partially moved value: `thefoo`
  --> $DIR/uninhabited-granular-moves.rs:30:11

LL |         Foo::Bar((a, _)) => { }
   |                   - value partially moved here
...
LL |     match thefoo {
   |           ^^^^^^ value used here after partial move
   |
   = note: partial move occurs because value has type `Box<u64>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
help: borrow this binding in the pattern to avoid moving the value
