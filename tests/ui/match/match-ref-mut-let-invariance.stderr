   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b`
   = note: requirement occurs because of a mutable reference to `&i32`
   = note: mutable references are invariant over their type parameter
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
