LL |     const CONST: (bool, dyn T);
   |                         ^^^^^ `T` is not dyn compatible

note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

LL |     const CONST: (bool, dyn T);
   |           ^^^^^ ...because it contains this associated `const`
   = help: consider moving `CONST` to another trait
help: you might have meant to use `Self` to refer to the implementing type
