LL |     #[test]
   |     ^^^^^^^ the `#[test]` macro causes a function to be run as a test and has no effect on non-functions

LL |     struct A5(u32, u8);
   |     ------------------- expected a non-associated function, found a struct
   |
help: replace with conditional compilation to make the item only exist when tests are being run
   |
LL |     #[cfg(test)]
