error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding

LL |     let Some(1) = loop {
   |         ^^^^^^^ pattern `None` not covered
   |
   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-02-refutability.html
   = note: the matched value is of type `Option<i32>`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched
