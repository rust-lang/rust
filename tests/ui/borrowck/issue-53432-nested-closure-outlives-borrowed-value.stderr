   |                   lifetime `'1` represents this closure's body
LL |         || f() // The `nested` closure
   |         ^^^^^^ returning this value requires that `'1` must outlive `'2`
   |
   = note: closure implements `Fn`, so references to captured variables can't escape the closure
help: consider adding 'move' keyword before the nested closure
