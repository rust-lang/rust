error[E0382]: use of moved value: `value`

LL | fn this_does_not<'a, R>(value: &'a mut Events<R>) {
   |                         ----- move occurs because `value` has type `&mut Events<R>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

   |                       ^^^^^ value moved here, in previous iteration of loop

note: consider changing this parameter type in function `handle` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary

help: consider moving the expression out of the loop so it is only moved once
