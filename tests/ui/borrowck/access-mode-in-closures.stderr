error[E0507]: cannot move out of `s` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/access-mode-in-closures.rs:8:15

LL |         match *s { S(v) => v }

   |                      data moved here
   |                      move occurs because `v` has type `Vec<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
help: consider removing the dereference here
