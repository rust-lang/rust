error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*x` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/borrowck-fn-in-const-a.rs:6:16
   |
LL |         return *x
   |                ^^ move occurs because `*x` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
LL -         return *x
LL +         return x.clone()
