LL |     let func = get_func::<T>(&String::new());
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - temporary value is freed at the end of this statement

   |                               creates a temporary value which is freed while still in use
LL |     drop(func);
   |          ---- borrow later used here
   |
help: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value

LL ~     let binding = String::new();
LL ~     let func = get_func::<T>(&binding);
