error[E0507]: cannot move out of `val`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure
  --> $DIR/issue-87456-point-to-closure.rs:10:28

LL |         let _foo: String = val;

help: `Fn` and `FnMut` closures require captured values to be able to be consumed multiple times, but `FnOnce` closures may consume them only once
