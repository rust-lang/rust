error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `state`
  --> $DIR/reborrow-sugg-move-then-borrow.rs:20:18

LL | fn fill_memory_blocks_mt(state: &mut State) {
   |                          ----- move occurs because `state` has type `&mut State`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     for _ in state {}
   |              ----- `state` moved due to this implicit call to `.into_iter()`

LL |     fill_segment(state);
   |                  ^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: `into_iter` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `state`
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/iter/traits/collect.rs:LL:COL
help: consider creating a fresh reborrow of `state` here
