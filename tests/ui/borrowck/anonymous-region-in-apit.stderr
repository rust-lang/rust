error[E0521]: borrowed data escapes outside of closure

LL | fn qux(foo: impl Foo<&str>) {
   |        --- lifetime `'2` appears in the type of `foo`
LL |     |baz: &str| foo.bar(baz);
   |      ---  -     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |      |    |     |
   |      |    |     `baz` escapes the closure body here
   |      |    |     argument requires that `'1` must outlive `'2`
   |      |    let's call the lifetime of this reference `'1`
   |      `baz` is a reference that is only valid in the closure body
