error: captured variable cannot escape `FnMut` closure body

   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ returns a closure that contains a reference to a captured variable, which then escapes the closure body

   = note: `FnMut` closures only have access to their captured variables while they are executing...
   = note: ...therefore, they cannot allow references to captured variables to escape
