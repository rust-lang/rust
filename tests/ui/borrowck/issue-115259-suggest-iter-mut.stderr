error[E0596]: cannot borrow `**layer` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> $DIR/issue-115259-suggest-iter-mut.rs:15:65

LL |         self.layers.iter().fold(0, |result, mut layer| result + layer.process())
   |                                             ---------           ^^^^^ `layer` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable

   |                                             consider changing this binding's type to be: `&mut Box<dyn Layer>`

help: you may want to use `iter_mut` here
   |
LL |         self.layers.iter_mut().fold(0, |result, mut layer| result + layer.process())
