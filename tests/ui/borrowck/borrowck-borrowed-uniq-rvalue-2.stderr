   |                    creates a temporary value which is freed while still in use
LL |     x.x[0];
   |     ------ borrow later used here

   = note: this error originates in the macro `vec` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value
