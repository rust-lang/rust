   = note: mutable references to mutable statics are dangerous; it's undefined behavior if any other pointer to the static is used or if any other reference is created for the static while the mutable reference lives
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_refs)]` (part of `#[warn(rust_2024_compatibility)]`) on by default
help: use `&raw mut` instead to create a raw pointer
