//! Check that we do not allow assigning twice to an immutable variable. This test also checks a
//! few pieces of borrowck diagnostics:
//!
//! - A multipart borrowck diagnostics that points out the first assignment to an immutable
//!   variable, alongside violating assignments that follow subsequently.
//! - A suggestion diagnostics to make the immutable binding mutable.
