error[E0507]: cannot move out of static item `D`

LL |         let a = $c;
   |                 ^^ move occurs because `D` has type `A`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

   | ------ in this macro invocation

note: if `A` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value

   = note: this error originates in the macro `aaa` which comes from the expansion of the macro `sss` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider borrowing here
