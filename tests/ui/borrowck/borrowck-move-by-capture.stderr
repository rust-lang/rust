error[E0507]: cannot move out of `bar`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure
  --> $DIR/borrowck-move-by-capture.rs:9:29

help: `Fn` and `FnMut` closures require captured values to be able to be consumed multiple times, but `FnOnce` closures may consume them only once

help: consider cloning the value before moving it into the closure
