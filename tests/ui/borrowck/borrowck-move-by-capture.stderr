error[E0507]: cannot move out of `bar`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure

   |                             |                  variable moved due to use in closure
   |                             |                  move occurs because `bar` has type `Box<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |                             `bar` is moved here
   |
help: consider cloning the value before moving it into the closure
   |
LL ~         let value = bar.clone();
LL ~         let _h = to_fn_once(move || -> isize { value });
