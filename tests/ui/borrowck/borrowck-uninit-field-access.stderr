error[E0382]: use of moved value: `line1.origin`
  --> $DIR/borrowck-uninit-field-access.rs:25:13
   |
LL |     let _moved = line1.origin;
   |                  ------------ value moved here
LL |     let _ = line1.origin.x + 1;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `line1.origin` has type `Point`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

error[E0382]: use of partially moved value: `line2`
  --> $DIR/borrowck-uninit-field-access.rs:29:5

LL |     let _moved = (line2.origin, line2.middle);
   |                                 ------------ value partially moved here
LL |     line2.consume();
   |     ^^^^^ value used here after partial move
   |
   = note: partial move occurs because `line2.middle` has type `Point`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
