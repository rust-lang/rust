LL |     fn f(&mut self) {
   |          --------- move occurs because `self` has type `&mut X`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |         generic(self);
   |                 ---- value moved here
LL |         self.0 += 1;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move

help: consider creating a fresh reborrow of `self` here
