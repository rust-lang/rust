error[E0507]: cannot move out of `x`, a captured variable in an `Fn` closure
  --> $DIR/borrowck-in-static.rs:5:17
   |
LL |     let x = Box::new(0);
   |         -   ----------- move occurs because `x` has type `Box<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |         |
   |         captured outer variable
LL |     Box::new(|| x)
   |              -- ^ `x` is moved here
   |              |
   |              captured by this `Fn` closure
   |
   = help: `Fn` and `FnMut` closures require captured values to be able to be consumed multiple times, but `FnOnce` closures may consume them only once
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
