error[E0594]: cannot assign to `*ptr`, which is behind a `*const` pointer

LL |     unsafe { *ptr = 3; }
   |              ^^^^^^^^ `ptr` is a `*const` pointer, so the data it refers to cannot be written
   |
help: consider changing this to be a mutable pointer

LL -     let ptr = &raw const val;
LL +     let ptr = &raw mut val;
