error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*array` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/issue-54597-reject-move-out-of-borrow-via-pat.rs:14:13
   |
LL |             *array
   |             ^^^^^^ move occurs because `*array` has type `Vec<Value>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: if `Value` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/issue-54597-reject-move-out-of-borrow-via-pat.rs:4:1
   |
LL | struct Value;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
...
LL |             *array
   |             ------ you could clone this value
help: consider removing the dereference here
   |
LL -             *array
LL +             array
