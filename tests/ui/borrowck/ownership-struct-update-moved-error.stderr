error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `start`
  --> $DIR/ownership-struct-update-moved-error.rs:18:20
   |
LL |     let start = Mine { test: "Foo".to_string(), other_val: 0 };
   |         ----- move occurs because `start` has type `Mine`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let end = Mine { other_val: 1, ..start.make_string_bar() };
   |                                            ----------------- `start` moved due to this method call
LL |     println!("{}", start.test);
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move

note: `Mine::make_string_bar` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `start`
