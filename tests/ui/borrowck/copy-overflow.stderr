error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*self` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/copy-overflow.rs:12:9
   |
LL |         *self
   |         ^^^^^ move occurs because `*self` has type `S<T>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
LL -         *self
LL +         self.clone()
