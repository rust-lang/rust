LL |     let val: &_ = x.borrow().0;
   |                   ^^^^^^^^^^  - temporary value is freed at the end of this statement
   |                   |
   |                   creates a temporary value which is freed while still in use
...
LL |     println!("{}", val);
   |                    --- borrow later used here
   |
help: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value

LL ~     let binding = x.borrow();
LL ~     let val: &_ = binding.0;
