error[E0507]: cannot move out of `self.b`, as `self` is a captured variable in an `Fn` closure

   |                  captured outer variable
   |                  move occurs because `self.b` has type `StructB`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |         let bar = self.b.bar().await;

LL |             self.b;
   |             ^^^^^^ `self.b` is moved here

help: `Fn` and `FnMut` closures require captured values to be able to be consumed multiple times, but `FnOnce` closures may consume them only once

note: if `StructB` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
