error[E0502]: cannot borrow `x` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable

LL |     let h = foreign::hello(&x);
   |                            -- immutable borrow occurs here
...
LL |     x.push(0);

...
LL |     println!("{h}");
   |                - immutable borrow later used here

note: this call may capture more lifetimes than intended, because Rust 2024 has adjusted the `impl Trait` lifetime capture rules

LL |     let h = foreign::hello(&x);
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: if you can modify this crate, add a precise capturing bound to avoid overcapturing: `+ use<>`

LL | pub fn hello(x: &Vec<i32>) -> impl Display { 0 }
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^
