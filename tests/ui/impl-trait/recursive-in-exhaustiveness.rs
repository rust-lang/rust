// Test several spicy non-trivial recursive opaque definitions inferred from HIR typeck
// don't cause stack overflows in exhaustiveness code, which currently reveals opaques
// manually in a way that is not overflow aware.
//
// These should eventually be outright rejected, but today (some) non-trivial recursive
// opaque definitions are accepted, and changing that requires an FCP, so for now just
// make sure we don't stack overflow :^)

// Opaque<T> = Opaque<Opaque<T>>
//
// We unfortunately accept this today, and due to how opaque type relating is implemented
// in the NLL type relation, this defines `Opaque<T> = T`.
