error[E0038]: the trait `Foo` is not dyn compatible

note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

LL |     fn baz(&self) -> impl Debug;
   |                      ^^^^^^^^^^ ...because method `baz` references an `impl Trait` type in its return type
   = help: consider moving `baz` to another trait
   = help: only type `u32` implements `Foo`; consider using it directly instead.
