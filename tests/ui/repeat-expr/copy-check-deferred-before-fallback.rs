// Test when deferring repeat expr checks to end of typechecking whether they're
// checked before integer fallback occurs. We accomplish this by having the repeat
// expr check allow inference progress on an ambiguous goal, where the ambiguous goal
// would fail if the inference variable was fallen back to `i32`. This test will
// pass if we check repeat exprs before integer fallback.
