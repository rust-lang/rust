// Test when deferring repeat expr copy checks to end of typechecking whether elements
// that are const items allow for repeat counts to go uninferred without an error being
// emitted if they would later wind up inferred by integer fallback.
//
// This test should be updated if we wind up deferring repeat expr checks until *after*
// integer fallback as the point of the test is not *specifically* about integer fallback
// but rather about the behaviour of `const` element exprs.
