error[E0382]: use of moved value: `foo`
  --> $DIR/pin-mut-reborrow.rs:14:5
   |
LL |     let mut foo = Pin::new(&mut foo);
   |         ------- move occurs because `foo` has type `Pin<&mut Foo>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     foo.foo();
   |         ----- `foo` moved due to this method call
LL |     foo.foo();
   |     ^^^ value used here after move
   |
note: `Foo::foo` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `foo`
  --> $DIR/pin-mut-reborrow.rs:7:12
   |
LL |     fn foo(self: Pin<&mut Self>) {}
   |            ^^^^
help: consider reborrowing the `Pin` instead of moving it
   |
LL |     foo.as_mut().foo();
