error[E0507]: cannot move out of dereference of `S`
  --> $DIR/needs-clone-through-deref.rs:15:18
   |
LL |         for _ in self.clone().into_iter() {}
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ----------- value moved due to this method call
   |                  |
   |                  move occurs because value has type `Vec<usize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: `into_iter` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves value
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/iter/traits/collect.rs:LL:COL
help: you can `clone` the value and consume it, but this might not be your desired behavior
   |
LL -         for _ in self.clone().into_iter() {}
LL +         for _ in <Vec<usize> as Clone>::clone(&self).into_iter() {}
