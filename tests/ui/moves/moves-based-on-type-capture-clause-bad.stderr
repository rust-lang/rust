error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/moves-based-on-type-capture-clause-bad.rs:9:20
   |
LL |     let x = "Hello world!".to_string();
   |         - move occurs because `x` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     thread::spawn(move || {
   |                   ------- value moved into closure here
LL |         println!("{}", x);
   |                        - variable moved due to use in closure
LL |     });
LL |     println!("{}", x);
   |                    ^ value borrowed here after move
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value before moving it into the closure

LL ~     let value = x.clone();
LL ~     thread::spawn(move || {
LL ~         println!("{}", value);
