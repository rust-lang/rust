error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/move-in-guard-1.rs:10:24
   |
LL |     let x: Box<_> = Box::new(1);
   |         - move occurs because `x` has type `Box<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
LL |         (1, _) if take(x) => (),
   |                        - value moved here
LL |         (_, 2) if take(x) => (),
   |                        ^ value used here after move

note: consider changing this parameter type in function `take` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
