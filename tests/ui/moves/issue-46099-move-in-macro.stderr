error[E0382]: use of moved value: `b`
  --> $DIR/issue-46099-move-in-macro.rs:14:12
   |
LL |     let b = Box::new(true);
   |         - move occurs because `b` has type `Box<bool>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     test!({b});
   |            ^ value used here after move
   |
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
LL |     test!({b.clone()});
