error[E0508]: cannot move out of type `[D; 4]`, a non-copy array
  --> $DIR/move-out-of-array-1.rs:17:5

LL |     a[i]
   |     ^^^^
   |     |
   |     cannot move out of here
   |     move occurs because `a[_]` has type `D`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: if `D` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/move-out-of-array-1.rs:5:1

LL | struct D { _x: u8 }
   | ^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
...
LL |     a[i]
   |     ---- you could clone this value
