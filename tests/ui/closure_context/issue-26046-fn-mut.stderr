error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnMut`
  --> $DIR/issue-26046-fn-mut.rs:4:19
   |
LL |     let closure = || {
   |                   ^^ this closure implements `FnMut`, not `Fn`
LL |         num += 1;
   |         --- closure is `FnMut` because it mutates the variable `num` here
...
LL |     Box::new(closure)
   |     ----------------- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
   |
   = note: required for the cast from `Box<{closure@$DIR/issue-26046-fn-mut.rs:4:19: 4:21}>` to `Box<(dyn Fn() + 'static)>`
