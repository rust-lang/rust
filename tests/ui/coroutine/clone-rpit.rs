// This stalls the goal `{coroutine} <: impl Clone`, since that has a nested goal
// of `{coroutine}: Clone`. That is only known if we can compute the generator
// witness types, which we don't know until after borrowck. When we later check
// the goal for correctness, we want to be able to bind the `impl Clone` opaque.
