// `foo` attempts to dereference `""`, which results in an error being reported. Later, the
// coroutine transform for `foo` then produces a union which contains a `str` type - unions should
// not contain unsized types, but this is okay because an error has been reported already.
// When const propagation happens later in compilation, it attempts to compute the layout of the
// coroutine (as part of checking whether something can be const propagated) and in turn attempts
// to compute the layout of `str` in the context of a union - where this caused an ICE. This test
// makes sure that doesn't happen again.
