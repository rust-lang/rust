help: within `{coroutine@$DIR/drop-yield-twice.rs:7:30: 7:32}`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Foo`
  --> $DIR/drop-yield-twice.rs:3:1

LL | struct Foo(i32);
   | ^^^^^^^^^^
note: coroutine is not `Send` as this value is used across a yield
  --> $DIR/drop-yield-twice.rs:9:9

LL |         let guard = Foo(42);
   |             ----- has type `Foo` which is not `Send`
LL |         yield;
   |         ^^^^^ yield occurs here, with `guard` maybe used later
note: required by a bound in `assert_send`
