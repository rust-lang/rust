error[E0382]: use of moved value: `first`
  --> $DIR/moved-twice.rs:21:22
   |
LL |         let first = Foo([0; FOO_SIZE]);
   |             ----- move occurs because `first` has type `Foo`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |         yield;
LL |         let second = first;
   |                      ----- value moved here

LL |         let second = first;
   |                      ^^^^^ value used here after move

note: if `Foo` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/moved-twice.rs:9:1

LL | struct Foo([u8; FOO_SIZE]);
   | ^^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
