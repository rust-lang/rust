error[E0509]: cannot move out of type `X`, which implements the `Drop` trait
  --> $DIR/disallowed-deconstructing-destructing-struct-let.rs:13:22

LL |     let X { x: y } = x;
   |                -     ^ cannot move out of here
   |                |
   |                data moved here
   |                move occurs because `y` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

help: consider borrowing the pattern binding
