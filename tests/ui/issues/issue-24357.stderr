error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/issue-24357.rs:10:12
   |
LL |    let x = NoCopy;
   |        - move occurs because `x` has type `NoCopy`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |
LL |    let f = move || { let y = x; };
   |            -------           - variable moved due to use in closure
   |            |
   |            value moved into closure here
...
LL |    let z = x;
   |            ^ value used here after move
   |
note: if `NoCopy` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value
  --> $DIR/issue-24357.rs:1:1
   |
LL | struct NoCopy;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
...
LL |    let f = move || { let y = x; };
   |                              - you could clone this value
