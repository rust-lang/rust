error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*key` which is behind a shared reference
  --> $DIR/issue-52262.rs:15:35
   |
LL |                 String::from_utf8(*key).unwrap()
   |                                   ^^^^ move occurs because `*key` has type `Vec<u8>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable

LL -                 String::from_utf8(*key).unwrap()
LL +                 String::from_utf8(key.clone()).unwrap()
