// This test case exposes conditions where the encoding of a trait object type
// with projection predicates would differ between this crate and the upstream
// crate, because the predicates were encoded in different order within each
// crate. This led to different symbol hashes of functions using these type,
// which in turn led to linker errors because the two crates would not agree on
// the symbol name.
// The fix was to make the order in which predicates get encoded stable.
