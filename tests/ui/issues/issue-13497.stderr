   = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from
help: consider using the `'static` lifetime, but this is uncommon unless you're returning a borrowed value from a `const` or a `static`

LL |     &'static str
   |      +++++++
help: instead, you are more likely to want to return an owned value
