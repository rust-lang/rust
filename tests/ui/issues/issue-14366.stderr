error[E0277]: the size for values of type `str` cannot be known at compilation time

   = help: the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `str`
   = note: required for the cast from `&'static str` to `&(dyn Any + 'static)`
help: consider borrowing the value, since `&&'static str` can be coerced into `&(dyn Any + 'static)`
