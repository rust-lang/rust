   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::panic::panic_2015` which comes from the expansion of the macro `panic` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

   = note: constants only support matching by type, if you meant to match against a range of values, consider using a range pattern like `min ..= max` in the match block
