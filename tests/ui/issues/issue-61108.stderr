error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `bad_letters`
  --> $DIR/issue-61108.rs:6:5
   |
LL |     let mut bad_letters = vec!['e', 't', 'o', 'i'];
   |         --------------- move occurs because `bad_letters` has type `Vec<char>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     for l in bad_letters {
   |              ----------- `bad_letters` moved due to this implicit call to `.into_iter()`
...
LL |     bad_letters.push('s');
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: `into_iter` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `bad_letters`
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/iter/traits/collect.rs:LL:COL
help: consider iterating over a slice of the `Vec<char>`'s content to avoid moving into the `for` loop
