error[E0764]: mutable borrows of temporaries that have their lifetime extended until the end of the program are not allowed
  --> $DIR/issue-46604.rs:1:25
   |
LL | static buf: &mut [u8] = &mut [1u8,2,3,4,5,7];
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this mutable borrow refers to such a temporary
   |
   = note: Temporaries in constants and statics can have their lifetime extended until the end of the program
   = note: To avoid accidentally creating global mutable state, such temporaries must be immutable
   = help: If you really want global mutable state, try replacing the temporary by an interior mutable `static` or a `static mut`

error[E0594]: cannot assign to `buf[_]`, as `buf` is an immutable static item
  --> $DIR/issue-46604.rs:6:5

LL |     buf[0]=2;
   |     ^^^^^^^^ cannot assign
