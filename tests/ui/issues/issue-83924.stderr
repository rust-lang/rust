error[E0382]: use of moved value: `v`
  --> $DIR/issue-83924.rs:15:14
   |
LL |     let v = &mut values;
   |         - move occurs because `v` has type `&mut Vec<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
LL |     for n in v {
   |              - `v` moved due to this implicit call to `.into_iter()`
...
LL |     for n in v {
   |              ^ value used here after move
   |
note: `into_iter` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `v`
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/iter/traits/collect.rs:LL:COL
help: consider creating a fresh reborrow of `v` here
