error[E0599]: the function or associated item `make_g` exists for fn pointer `fn(&())`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `for<'a> fn(&'a ()): X`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
note: `X` defines an item `make_g`, perhaps you need to implement it
