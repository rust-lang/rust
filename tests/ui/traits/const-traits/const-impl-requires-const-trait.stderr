error: const `impl` for trait `A` which is not marked with `#[const_trait]`

LL | impl const A for () {}
   |            ^ this trait is not `const`

   = note: marking a trait with `#[const_trait]` ensures all default method bodies are `const`
   = note: adding a non-const method body in the future would be a breaking change
help: mark `A` as `#[const_trait]` to allow it to have `const` implementations
