   = note: see issue #118304 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/118304> for more information
   = help: add `#![feature(derive_const)]` to the crate attributes to enable
   = note: this compiler was built on YYYY-MM-DD; consider upgrading it if it is out of date

error: const `impl` for trait `Debug` which is not `const`

LL | #[derive_const(Debug)]
   |                ^^^^^ this trait is not `const`
   |
   = note: marking a trait with `const` ensures all default method bodies are `const`
   = note: adding a non-const method body in the future would be a breaking change

error[E0015]: cannot call non-const method `Formatter::<'_>::write_str` in constant functions

LL | #[derive_const(Debug)]
   |                ^^^^^

   = note: calls in constant functions are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants
