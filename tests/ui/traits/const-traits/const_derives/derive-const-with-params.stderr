   = note: marking a trait with `#[const_trait]` ensures all default method bodies are `const`
   = note: adding a non-const method body in the future would be a breaking change
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `PartialEq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: `~const` can only be applied to `#[const_trait]` traits
