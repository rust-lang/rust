error[E0015]: cannot call non-const associated function `<T as A>::assoc` in constant functions

LL | pub const fn foo<T: A>() -> bool {
   | -------------------------------- calls in constant functions are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants
LL |     T::assoc()

note: associated function `assoc` is not const because trait `A` is not const

LL | pub trait A {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^ this trait is not const
LL |     fn assoc() -> bool;

help: consider making trait `A` const
