                     found tuple `(T, ())`
   = help: `(T, ())` implements `Span` so you could box the found value and coerce it to the trait object `Box<dyn Span>`, you will have to change the expected type as well
help: call `Into::into` on this expression to convert `(T, ())` into `(dyn Span<T> + 'static)`
