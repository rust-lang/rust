error[E0038]: the trait alias `BB` is not dyn compatible
  --> $DIR/self-in-const-generics.rs:9:16

LL | fn foo(x: &dyn BB) {}
   |                ^^ `BB` is not dyn compatible
   |
note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

LL | trait BB = Bar<{ 2 + 1 }>;
   |       --   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...because it uses `Self` as a type parameter
   |       |
   |       this trait is not dyn compatible...
help: consider using an opaque type instead

LL - fn foo(x: &dyn BB) {}
LL + fn foo(x: &impl BB) {}
