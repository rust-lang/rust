   = help: within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `*const i32`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

LL |     let a = &1 as *const i32;
   |         - has type `*const i32` which is not `Send`
LL |     async {}.await;
   |              ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `a` maybe used later
note: required by a bound in `require_handler`
