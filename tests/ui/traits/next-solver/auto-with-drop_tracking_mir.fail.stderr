LL |     is_send(foo());
   |             ^^^^^ future returned by `foo` is not `Send`

help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `NotSync`
  --> $DIR/auto-with-drop_tracking_mir.rs:8:1
   |
LL | struct NotSync;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await
  --> $DIR/auto-with-drop_tracking_mir.rs:16:11
   |
LL |     let x = &NotSync;
   |         - has type `&NotSync` which is not `Send`
LL |     bar().await;
   |           ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `x` maybe used later
note: required by a bound in `is_send`

LL |     fn is_send(_: impl Send) {}
   |                        ^^^^ required by this bound in `is_send`
