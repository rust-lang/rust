LL |     let x: Vec<dyn Trait + Sized> = Vec::new();
   |                    ^^^^^   ----- first non-auto trait
   |                    |
   |                    additional non-auto trait
   |
   = help: consider creating a new trait with all of these as supertraits and using that trait here instead: `trait NewTrait: Sized + Trait {}`
   = note: auto-traits like `Send` and `Sync` are traits that have special properties; for more information on them, visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/special-types-and-traits.html#auto-traits>
