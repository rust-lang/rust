error[E0038]: the trait `Tr` is not dyn compatible

note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

LL |     fn foo();
   |        ^^^ ...because associated function `foo` has no `self` parameter
   = help: only type `St` implements `Tr`; consider using it directly instead.
help: consider turning `foo` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument

LL |     fn foo(&self);

help: alternatively, consider constraining `foo` so it does not apply to trait objects
