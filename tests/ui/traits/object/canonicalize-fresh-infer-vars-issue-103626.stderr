error[E0038]: the trait `FromResidual` is not dyn compatible

note: for a trait to be dyn compatible it needs to allow building a vtable

help: consider turning `from_residual` into a method by giving it a `&self` argument

help: alternatively, consider constraining `from_residual` so it does not apply to trait objects
