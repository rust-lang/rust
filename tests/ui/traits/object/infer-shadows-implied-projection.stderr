warning: associated type bound for `Inner` in `dyn Database` differs from associated type bound from supertrait
  --> $DIR/infer-shadows-implied-projection.rs:18:26

LL | trait Database: Restriction<Inner = u32> {}
   |                             ----------- shadowed due to this supertrait bound
...

   |                          ^^^^^^^^^ this bound has no effect and will be ignored

   = note: `Inner = u32` was implied by a supertrait and shadows any user-written bounds, so `Inner = _` will be ignored
   = note: `#[warn(dyn_assoc_shadowed)]` on by default
