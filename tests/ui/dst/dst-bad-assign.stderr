LL |     f5.ptr = Bar1 {f: 36};
   |     ------   ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `dyn ToBar`, found `Bar1`
   |     |
   |     expected due to the type of this binding
   |
   = note: expected trait object `dyn ToBar`
                    found struct `Bar1`
   = help: `Bar1` implements `ToBar` so you could box the found value and coerce it to the trait object `Box<dyn ToBar>`, you will have to change the expected type as well

error[E0277]: the size for values of type `dyn ToBar` cannot be known at compilation time
  --> $DIR/dst-bad-assign.rs:35:5

LL |     f5.ptr = Bar1 {f: 36};
   |     ^^^^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |
   = help: the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `dyn ToBar`
   = note: the left-hand-side of an assignment must have a statically known size
