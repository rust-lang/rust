   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `dyn Foo: Sized`
           which is required by `Box<dyn Foo>: Clone`
           `dyn Foo: Clone`
           which is required by `Box<dyn Foo>: Clone`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Clone`
