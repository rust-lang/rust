error[E0599]: the method `clone` exists for struct `Box<R>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `R: CloneToUninit`
           which is required by `Box<R>: Clone`
note: the trait `CloneToUninit` must be implemented
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/clone.rs:LL:COL
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `clone`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Clone`
