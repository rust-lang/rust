LL |         &s
   |         ^^ the trait `Borrow<&str>` is not implemented for `String`
   |
   = help: the trait `Borrow<&_>` is not implemented for `String`
           but trait `Borrow<_>` is implemented for it
   = help: for that trait implementation, expected `str`, found `&str`
   = note: required for `HashMap<String, String>` to implement `Index<&&str>`
