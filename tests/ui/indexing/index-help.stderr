error[E0277]: the type `[{integer}]` cannot be indexed by `i32`

   = help: the trait `SliceIndex<[{integer}]>` is not implemented for `i32`
           but it is implemented for `usize`
   = help: for that trait implementation, expected `usize`, found `i32`
   = note: required for `Vec<{integer}>` to implement `Index<i32>`
