error[E0277]: the trait bound `Inner<T>: Clone` is not satisfied

LL | #[derive(Clone)]

LL | struct Outer<T>(Inner<T>);
   |                 ^^^^^^^^ the trait `Clone` is not implemented for `Inner<T>`

help: consider annotating `Inner<T>` with `#[derive(Clone)]`
   |
LL + #[derive(Clone)]
LL | struct Inner<T>(T);

help: consider introducing a `where` clause, but there might be an alternative better way to express this requirement
   |
LL | struct Outer<T>(Inner<T>) where Inner<T>: Clone;
