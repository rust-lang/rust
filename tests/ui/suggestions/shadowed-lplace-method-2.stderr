LL |     *x.foo(0) = ();
   |     ---------   ^^ expected `X`, found `()`
   |     |
   |     expected due to the type of this binding

note: the `foo` call is resolved to the method in `X`, shadowing the method of the same name on trait `A`

LL |     *x.foo(0) = ();
   |        ^^^ refers to `X::foo`
help: you might have meant to call the other method; you can use the fully-qualified path to call it explicitly

help: try wrapping the expression in `X`
