LL |     *rc.borrow_mut() = false;
   |     ----------------   ^^^^^ expected `Rc<RefCell<bool>>`, found `bool`
   |     |
   |     expected due to the type of this binding
   |
   = note: expected struct `Rc<RefCell<bool>>`
                found type `bool`
note: the `borrow_mut` call is resolved to the method in `std::borrow::BorrowMut`, shadowing the method of the same name on the inherent impl for `std::cell::RefCell<T>`

LL | use std::borrow::BorrowMut;
   |     ---------------------- `std::borrow::BorrowMut` imported here
...
LL |     *rc.borrow_mut() = false;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^ refers to `std::borrow::BorrowMut::borrow_mut`
help: you might have meant to call the other method; you can use the fully-qualified path to call it explicitly

LL -     *rc.borrow_mut() = false;
LL +     *std::cell::RefCell::<_>::borrow_mut(&rc) = false;
