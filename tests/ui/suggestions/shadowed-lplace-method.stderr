   = note: expected struct `Rc<RefCell<bool>>`
                found type `bool`
note: the `borrow_mut` call is resolved to the method in `std::borrow::BorrowMut`, shadowing the method of the same name on the inherent impl for `std::cell::RefCell<T>`

LL |     *rc.borrow_mut() = false;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^ refers to `std::borrow::BorrowMut::borrow_mut`
help: you might have meant to call the other method; you can use the fully-qualified path to call it explicitly
