// Regression test for #87481: short backtrace formatting cut off the entire stack trace.

// Codegen-units is specified here so that we can replicate a typical rustc invocation which
// is not normally limited to 1 CGU. This is important so that the `__rust_begin_short_backtrace`
// and `__rust_end_short_backtrace` symbols are not marked internal to the CGU and thus will be
// named in the symbol table.
//@ compile-flags: -O -Ccodegen-units=8

//@ run-fail
//@ check-run-results
//@ exec-env:RUST_BACKTRACE=1

// We need to normalize out frame 5 because without debug info, dbghelp.dll doesn't know where CGU
// internal functions like `main` start or end and so it will return whatever symbol happens
// to be located near the address.
//@ normalize-stderr-test: "5: .*" -> "5: some Rust fn"

// Backtraces are pretty broken in general on i686-pc-windows-msvc (#62897).
//@ only-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
