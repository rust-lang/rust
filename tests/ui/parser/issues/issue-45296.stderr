LL |     fn foo() {}
   |     ----------- the inner attribute doesn't annotate this function
   |
   = note: inner attributes, like `#![no_std]`, annotate the item enclosing them, and are usually found at the beginning of source files
help: to annotate the function, change the attribute from inner to outer style
