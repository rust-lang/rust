// Regression test for issue #48508:
//
// Confusion between global and local file offsets caused incorrect handling of multibyte character
// spans when compiling multiple files. One visible effect was an ICE generating debug information
// when a multibyte character is at the end of a scope. The problematic code is actually in
// issue-48508-aux.rs
