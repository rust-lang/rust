LL |     extern "C" {
   |     ---------- `extern` blocks define existing foreign functions and functions inside of them cannot have a body
LL |         fn f5(); // OK.
LL |         fn f6() {}
   |            ^^ cannot have a body
   |
   = help: you might have meant to write a function accessible through FFI, which can be done by writing `extern fn` outside of the `extern` block
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.extern.html
help: remove the invalid body
