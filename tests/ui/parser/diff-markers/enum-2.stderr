   = note: conflict markers indicate that a merge was started but could not be completed due to merge conflicts
           to resolve a conflict, keep only the code you want and then delete the lines containing conflict markers
   = help: if you are in a merge, the top section is the code you already had checked out and the bottom section is the new code
           if you are in a rebase, the top section is the code being rebased onto and the bottom section is the code you had checked out which is being rebased
   = note: for an explanation on these markers from the `git` documentation, visit <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging#_checking_out_conflicts>
