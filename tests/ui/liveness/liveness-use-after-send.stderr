error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `message`
  --> $DIR/liveness-use-after-send.rs:16:20

LL | fn test00_start(ch: Chan<Box<isize>>, message: Box<isize>, _count: Box<isize>) {
   |                                       ------- move occurs because `message` has type `Box<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     send(ch, message);
   |              ------- value moved here
LL |     println!("{}", message);
   |                    ^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: consider changing this parameter type in function `send` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary

LL | fn send<T:Send + std::fmt::Debug>(ch: Chan<T>, data: T) {
   |    ---- in this function                             ^ this parameter takes ownership of the value
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
