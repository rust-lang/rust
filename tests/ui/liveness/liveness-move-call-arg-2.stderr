error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`

LL |         let x: Box<isize> = Box::new(25);
   |             - move occurs because `x` has type `Box<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

LL |         loop {

note: consider changing this parameter type in function `take` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
