error[E0116]: cannot define inherent `impl` for a type outside of the crate where the type is defined
  --> $DIR/insufficient-suggestion-issue-141679.rs:6:1

LL | impl Function {}
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ impl for type defined outside of crate
   |
   = help: consider defining a trait and implementing it for the type or using a newtype wrapper like `struct MyType(ExternalType);` and implement it
   = note: For more details about orphan rules, see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html?highlight=orphan#orphan-rules>
note: `Function` does not define a new type, just alias of `Rc<Foo>` defined here
