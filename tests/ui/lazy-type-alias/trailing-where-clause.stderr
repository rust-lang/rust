error[E0277]: the trait bound `String: From<()>` is not satisfied
  --> $DIR/trailing-where-clause.rs:12:18

LL |     let _: Alias<()>;
   |                  ^^ the trait `From<()>` is not implemented for `String`

   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             <String as From<char>>
             <String as From<Box<str>>>
             <String as From<Cow<'a, str>>>
             <String as From<&str>>
             <String as From<&mut str>>
             <String as From<&String>>
note: required by a bound in `Alias`
