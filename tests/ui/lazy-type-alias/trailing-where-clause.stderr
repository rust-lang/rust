error[E0277]: the trait bound `String: From<()>` is not satisfied
  --> $DIR/trailing-where-clause.rs:12:18

LL |     let _: Alias<()>;
   |                  ^^ the trait `From<()>` is not implemented for `String`
   |
   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             `String` implements `From<&String>`
             `String` implements `From<&mut str>`
             `String` implements `From<&str>`
             `String` implements `From<Box<str>>`
             `String` implements `From<Cow<'_, str>>`
             `String` implements `From<char>`
note: required by a bound in `Alias`
