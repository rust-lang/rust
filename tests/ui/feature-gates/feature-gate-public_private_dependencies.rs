// This test is different from other feature gate tests.
// Instead of checking that an error occurs without the feature gate,
// it checks that *no* errors/warnings occurs without the feature gate.
// This is due to the fact that 'public_private_dependencies' just enables
// a lint, so disabling it shouldn't cause any code to stop compiling.
