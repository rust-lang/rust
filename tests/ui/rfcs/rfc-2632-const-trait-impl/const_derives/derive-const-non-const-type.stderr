error: const `impl` for trait `Default` which is not marked with `#[const_trait]`

   |                ^^^^^^^

   = note: marking a trait with `#[const_trait]` ensures all default method bodies are `const`
   = note: adding a non-const method body in the future would be a breaking change
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Default` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
