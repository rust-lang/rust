error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
  --> $DIR/dbg-macro-move-semantics.rs:9:13

LL |     let a = NoCopy(0);
   |         - move occurs because `a` has type `NoCopy`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let _ = dbg!(a);
   |             ------- value moved here
LL |     let _ = dbg!(a);
   |             ^^^^^^^ value used here after move

help: consider borrowing instead of transferring ownership
