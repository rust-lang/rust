error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `g`
  --> $DIR/issue-105084.rs:44:14
   |
LL |     let mut g = || {
   |         ----- move occurs because `g` has type `[generator@$DIR/issue-105084.rs:22:17: 22:19]`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
LL |     let mut h = copy(g);
   |                      - value moved here
...
LL |     Pin::new(&mut g).resume(());
   |              ^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: consider changing this parameter type in function `copy` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
