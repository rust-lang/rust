   = note: ambiguous because of a conflict between a name from a glob import and an outer scope during import or macro resolution
   = note: `std` could refer to a built-in crate
note: `std` could also refer to the module imported here

   |         ^^^^^
   = help: consider adding an explicit import of `std` to disambiguate
   = help: or use `self::std` to refer to this module unambiguously
