   = note: the macro call doesn't expand to an expression, but it can expand to a statement
   = note: this error originates in the macro `statement` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: surround the macro invocation with `{}` to interpret the expansion as a statement
