error[E0010]: allocations are not allowed in constants

   = note: The value of statics and constants must be known at compile time, and they live for the entire lifetime of a program. Creating a boxed value allocates memory on the heap at runtime, and therefore cannot be done at compile time.
   = note: this error originates in the macro `vec` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
