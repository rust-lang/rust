error[E0026]: struct `Thing` does not have a field named `z`

   = note: This error indicates that a struct pattern attempted to extract a nonexistent field from a struct. Struct fields are identified by the name used before the colon : so struct patterns should resemble the declaration of the struct type being matched.
           
           If you are using shorthand field patterns but want to refer to the struct field by a different name, you should rename it explicitly.
