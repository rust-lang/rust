error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding
  --> $DIR/E0005.rs:3:9
   |
LL |     let Some(y) = x;
   |         ^^^^^^^ pattern `None` not covered
   |
   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-02-refutability.html
   = note: the matched value is of type `Option<i32>`
help: you might want to use `let else` to handle the variant that isn't matched
