error: incorrect function inside `extern` block

LL | extern "C" {
   | ---------- `extern` blocks define existing foreign functions and functions inside of them cannot have a body
LL |     fn a(&mut self) {
   |        ^ cannot have a body
   |
   = help: you might have meant to write a function accessible through FFI, which can be done by writing `extern fn` outside of the `extern` block

help: remove the invalid body
