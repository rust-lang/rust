error: lifetime may not live long enough

   |        |
   |        has type `&mut Foo<'2>`
LL |     foo.modify();
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ argument requires that `'1` must outlive `'2`

   = note: requirement occurs because of a mutable reference to `Foo<'_>`
   = note: mutable references are invariant over their type parameter
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
help: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter
