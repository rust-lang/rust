   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'b: 'a`
   = note: requirement occurs because of a mutable reference to `Vec<Ref<'_>>`
   = note: mutable references are invariant over their type parameter
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
