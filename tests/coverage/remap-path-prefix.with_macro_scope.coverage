   LL|       |// When coverage paths are remapped, the coverage-run mode can't find source files (because
   LL|       |// it doesn't know about the remapping), so it produces an empty coverage report. The empty
   LL|       |// report (i.e. no `.coverage` files) helps to demonstrate that remapping was indeed performed.
