Number of files: 1
- file 0 => global file 1
Number of expressions: 2
- expression 0 operands: lhs = Counter(0), rhs = Counter(1)
- expression 1 operands: lhs = Counter(0), rhs = Counter(2)
Number of file 0 mappings: 4
- Code(Counter(0)) at (prev + 8, 1) to (start + 3, 28)
- Code(Counter(1)) at (prev + 4, 13) to (start + 0, 19)
- Code(Expression(0, Sub)) at (prev + 2, 13) to (start + 0, 19)
    = (c0 - c1)
- Code(Expression(1, Sub)) at (prev + 3, 5) to (start + 1, 2)
