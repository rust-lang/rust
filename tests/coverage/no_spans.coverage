   LL|       |// refinement loop will terminate with nothing in its `prev` slot. If the
   LL|       |// subsequent code tries to unwrap `prev`, it will panic.
   LL|       |//
   LL|       |// This scenario became more likely after #118525 started discarding spans that
   LL|       |// can't be un-expanded back to within the function body.
