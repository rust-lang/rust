// Regression test for #41697. Using dump-mir was triggering
// artificial cycles: during type-checking, we had to get the MIR for
// the constant expressions in `[u8; 2]`, which in turn would trigger
// an attempt to get the def-path, which in turn would request the
// types of the impl, which would trigger a cycle. We suppressed this
// cycle now by forcing mir-dump to avoid asking for types of an impl.
