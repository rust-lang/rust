// EMIT_MIR small_blocks_inline_threshold.main.Inline.after.mir

// Test case generated to detect flipped threshold condition on `check_mir_body`.
// The decision of whether to inline (or not) a block of code is decided by its 
// cost of inlining, compared to the block's inline threshold
// Normally small bonus is given to the inline threshold for small blocks, via
//  threshold += threshold / 4
// where inline will only be performed if the cost <= threshold.

// This test checks that the decision to increase the threshold for small blocks
// has been applied correctly. This test was generated by a fuzzer.
