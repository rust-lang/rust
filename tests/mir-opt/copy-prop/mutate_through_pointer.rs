//@ test-mir-pass: CopyProp
//
// This attempts to mutate `a` via a pointer derived from `addr_of!(a)`. That is UB
// according to Miri. However, the decision to make this UB - and to allow
// rustc to rely on that fact for the purpose of optimizations - has not been
// finalized.
//
// As such, we include this test to ensure that copy prop does not rely on that
// fact. Specifically, if `addr_of!(a)` could not be used to modify a, it would
// be correct for CopyProp to replace all occurrences of `a` with `c` - but that
// would cause `f(true)` to output `false` instead of `true`.
