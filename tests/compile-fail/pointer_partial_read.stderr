   |                         ^^ unable to turn pointer into raw bytes

   = help: this is likely not a bug in the program; it indicates that the program performed an operation that the interpreter does not support
           
   = note: inside `main` at $DIR/pointer_partial_read.rs:LL:CC

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace

error: aborting due to previous error
