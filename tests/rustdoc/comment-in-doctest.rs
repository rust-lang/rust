// comments, both doc comments and regular ones, used to trick rustdoc's doctest parser into
// thinking that everything after it was part of the regular program. combined with the librustc_ast
// parser loop failing to detect the manual main function, it would wrap everything in `fn main`,
// which would cause the doctest to fail as the "extern crate" declaration was no longer valid.
// oddly enough, it would pass in 2018 if a crate was in the extern prelude. see
