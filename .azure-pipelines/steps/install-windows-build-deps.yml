# If we need to download a custom MinGW, do so here and set the path

#
# Here we also do a pretty heinous thing which is to mangle the MinGW
# installation we just downloaded. Currently, as of this writing, we're using
# MinGW-w64 builds of gcc, and that's currently at 6.3.0. We use 6.3.0 as it
# appears to be the first version which contains a fix for #40546, builds
# randomly failing during LLVM due to ar.exe/ranlib.exe failures.
#
# Unfortunately, though, 6.3.0 *also* is the first version of MinGW-w64 builds
# to contain a regression in gdb (#40184). As a result if we were to use the
# gdb provided (7.11.1) then we would fail all debuginfo tests.
#
# In order to fix spurious failures (pretty high priority) we use 6.3.0. To
# avoid disabling gdb tests we download an *old* version of gdb, specifically
# that found inside the 6.2.0 distribution. We then overwrite the 6.3.0 gdb
# with the 6.2.0 gdb to get tests passing.
#
# Note that we don't literally overwrite the gdb.exe binary because it appears
# to just use gdborig.exe, so that's the binary we deal with instead.
