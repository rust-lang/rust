/// This lock is equivalent to [`RwLock`], except read operations are faster and write operations

/// A `ShardedLock` is internally made of a list of *shards*, each being a [`RwLock`] occupying a
/// single cache line. Read operations will pick one of the shards depending on the current thread
/// and lock it. Write operations need to lock all shards in succession.
///
/// By splitting the lock into shards, concurrent read operations will in most cases choose
/// different shards and thus update different cache lines, which is good for scalability. However,
/// write operations need to do more work and are therefore slower than usual.

/// implementation, and this type does not guarantee that any particular policy will be used.

///
/// A `ShardedLock`, like [`RwLock`], will become poisoned on a panic. Note that it may only be
/// poisoned if a panic occurs while a write operation is in progress. If a panic occurs in any
/// read operation, the lock will not be poisoned.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use crossbeam_utils::sync::ShardedLock;
///
/// let lock = ShardedLock::new(5);
///
/// // Any number of read locks can be held at once.
/// {
