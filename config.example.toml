# C compiler to be used to compile C code. Note that the

# what platform is crossing to what platform.
# See `src/bootstrap/cc_detect.rs` for details.

# Linker to be used to bootstrap Rust code. Note that the

#linker = "cc" (path)

# Should rustc and the standard library be built with split debuginfo? Default
# is platform dependent.
#
# Valid values are the same as those accepted by `-C split-debuginfo`
# (`off`/`unpacked`/`packed`).
#
# On Linux, split debuginfo is disabled by default.
#
# On Apple platforms, unpacked split debuginfo is used by default. Unpacked
# debuginfo does not run `dsymutil`, which packages debuginfo from disparate
# object files into a single `.dSYM` file. `dsymutil` adds time to builds for
# no clear benefit, and also makes it more difficult for debuggers to find
# debug info. The compiler currently defaults to running `dsymutil` to preserve
# its historical default, but when compiling the compiler itself, we skip it by
# default since we know it's safe to do so in that case.
#
# On Windows platforms, packed debuginfo is the only supported option,
# producing a `.pdb` file.

# `libgcc_s.so`, 'in-tree' means static link to the in-tree build of llvm libunwind
# and 'system' means dynamic link to `libunwind.so`. If crt-static is enabled,
# the behavior is depend on the libc. On musl target, 'no' and 'in-tree' both
# means static link to the in-tree build of llvm libunwind, and 'system' means
# static link to `libunwind.a` provided by system. Due to the limitation of glibc,
# it must link to `libgcc_eh.a` to get a working output, and this option have no effect.
