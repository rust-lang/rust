# Mirror DockerHub images used by the Rust project to ghcr.io.
# Images are available at https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/packages.
#
# In some CI jobs, we pull images from ghcr.io instead of Docker Hub because
# Docker Hub has a rate limit, while ghcr.io doesn't.
# Those images are pushed to ghcr.io by this job.
#
# While Docker Hub rate limit *shouldn't* be an issue on GitHub Actions,
# it certainly is for AWS codebuild.
#
# Note that authenticating to DockerHub or other registries isn't possible
# for PR jobs, because forks can't access secrets.
# That's why we use ghcr.io: it has no rate limit and it doesn't require authentication.
