# ECOSYSTEM FEATURES

# The 'std' feature permits the regex crate to use the standard library. This
# is intended to support future use cases where the regex crate may be able
# to compile without std, and instead just rely on 'core' and 'alloc' (for
# example). Currently, this isn't supported, and removing the 'std' feature
# will prevent regex from compiling.

# The 'use_std' feature is DEPRECATED. It will be removed in regex 2. Until
# then, it is an alias for the 'std' feature.

# PERFORMANCE FEATURES

# Enables all performance features.

# dependency and use a slower internal cache, but now the default cache has
# been improved and thread_local is no longer a dependency at all.
