Hey! It looks like you've submitted a new PR for the library teams!

If this PR contains changes to any `rust-lang/rust` public library APIs then \
please comment with `@rustbot label +T-libs-api -T-libs` to tag it \
appropriately. If this PR contains changes to any unstable APIs please edit \
the PR description to add a link to the relevant [API Change \
Proposal](https://std-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/feature-lifecycle/api-change-proposals.html) \

just leave it as is and the reviewer will take a look and make a decision to \

Examples of `T-libs-api` changes:

* Stabilizing library features
* Introducing insta-stable changes such as new implementations of existing \
  stable traits on existing stable types
* Introducing new or changing existing unstable library APIs (excluding \
  permanently unstable features / features without a tracking issue)
* Changing public documentation in ways that create new stability guarantees
* Changing observable runtime behavior of library APIs
