"A package identifier identifies a package uniquely.  A package can be stored "
"in a workspace on the local file system, or on a remote Web server, in which "
"case the package ID resembles a URL.  For example, `github.com/mozilla/rust` "
"is a package ID that would refer to the git repository browsable at `http://"
"github.com/mozilla/rust`.  A package ID can also specify a version, like: "
"`github.com/mozilla/rust#0.3`.  In this case, `rustpkg` will check that the "
"repository `github.com/mozilla/rust` has a tag named `0.3`, and report an "
"error otherwise.  A package ID can also specify a particular revision of a "
"repository, like: `github.com/mozilla/rust#release-0.7`.  When the refspec "
"(portion of the package ID after the `#`) can't be parsed as a decimal "
"number, rustpkg passes the refspec along to the version control system "
"without interpreting it.  rustpkg also interprets any dependencies on such a "
"package ID literally (as opposed to versions, where a newer version "
"satisfies a dependency on an older version).  Thus, `github.com/mozilla/"
"rust#5c4cd30f80` is also a valid package ID, since git can deduce that "
"5c4cd30f80 refers to a revision of the desired repository."
