"Macros, as currently implemented, are not for the faint of heart. Even "
"ordinary syntax errors can be more difficult to debug when they occur inside "
"a macro, and errors caused by parse problems in generated code can be very "
"tricky. Invoking the `log_syntax!` macro can help elucidate intermediate "
"states, invoking `trace_macros!(true)` will automatically print those "
"intermediate states out, and passing the flag `--pretty expanded` as a "
"command-line argument to the compiler will show the result of expansion."
