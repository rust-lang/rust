  Hello!

  We are very interested in any feature requests you may have.

  However, please be aware that core::simd exists to address concerns with creating a portable SIMD API for Rust.
  Requests for extensions to compiler features, such as `target_feature`, binary versioning for SIMD APIs, or
  improving specific compilation issues in general should be discussed at https://internals.rust-lang.org/
-->
