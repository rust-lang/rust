# These dependencies of the standard library implement symbolication for
# backtraces on most platforms. Their debuginfo causes both linking to be slower
# (more data to chew through) and binaries to be larger without really all that
# much benefit. This section turns them all to down to have no debuginfo which
# helps to improve link times a little bit.
