# The compiler-builtins crate cannot reference libcore, and it's own CI will
# verify that this is the case. This requires, however, that the crate is built
# without overflow checks and debug assertions. Forcefully disable debug
# assertions and overflow checks here which should ensure that even if these
# assertions are enabled for libstd we won't enable then for compiler_builtins
# which should ensure we still link everything correctly.
debug-assertions = false
overflow-checks = false

# For compiler-builtins we always use a high number of codegen units.
# The goal here is to place every single intrinsic into its own object
# file to avoid symbol clashes with the system libgcc if possible. Note
# that this number doesn't actually produce this many object files, we
# just don't create more than this number of object files.
#
# It's a bit of a bummer that we have to pass this here, unfortunately.
# Ideally this would be specified through an env var to Cargo so Cargo
# knows how many CGUs are for this specific crate, but for now
# per-crate configuration isn't specifiable in the environment.
codegen-units = 10000

# These dependencies of the standard library implement symbolication for
# backtraces on most platforms. Their debuginfo causes both linking to be slower
# (more data to chew through) and binaries to be larger without really all that
# much benefit. This section turns them all to down to have no debuginfo which
# helps to improve link times a little bit.
