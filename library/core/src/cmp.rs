//! Utilities for comparing and ordering values.
//!
//! This module contains various tools for comparing and ordering values. In
//! summary:
//!
//! * [`PartialEq<Rhs>`] overloads the `==` and `!=` operators. In cases where
//!   `Rhs` (the right hand side's type) is `Self`, this trait corresponds to a
//!   partial equivalence relation.
//! * [`Eq`] indicates that the overloaded `==` operator corresponds to an
//!   equivalence relation.
//! * [`Ord`] and [`PartialOrd`] are traits that allow you to define total and
//!   partial orderings between values, respectively. Implementing them overloads
//!   the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` operators.
//! * [`Ordering`] is an enum returned by the main functions of [`Ord`] and
//!   [`PartialOrd`], and describes an ordering of two values (less, equal, or
//!   greater).
//! * [`Reverse`] is a struct that allows you to easily reverse an ordering.
//! * [`max`] and [`min`] are functions that build off of [`Ord`] and allow you
//!   to find the maximum or minimum of two values.
//!
//! For more details, see the respective documentation of each item in the list.
//!
//! [`max`]: Ord::max
//! [`min`]: Ord::min

/// Trait for comparisons using the equality operator.
///
/// Implementing this trait for types provides the `==` and `!=` operators for
/// those types.
///
/// `x.eq(y)` can also be written `x == y`, and `x.ne(y)` can be written `x != y`.
/// We use the easier-to-read infix notation in the remainder of this documentation.
///
/// This trait allows for comparisons using the equality operator, for types
/// that do not have a full equivalence relation. For example, in floating point
/// numbers `NaN != NaN`, so floating point types implement `PartialEq` but not
/// [`trait@Eq`]. Formally speaking, when `Rhs == Self`, this trait corresponds
/// to a [partial equivalence relation].
///
/// [partial equivalence relation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_equivalence_relation
///
/// Implementations must ensure that `eq` and `ne` are consistent with each other:
///
/// - `a != b` if and only if `!(a == b)`.
///
/// The default implementation of `ne` provides this consistency and is almost
/// always sufficient. It should not be overridden without very good reason.
///
/// If [`PartialOrd`] or [`Ord`] are also implemented for `Self` and `Rhs`, their methods must also
/// be consistent with `PartialEq` (see the documentation of those traits for the exact
/// requirements). It's easy to accidentally make them disagree by deriving some of the traits and
/// manually implementing others.
///
/// The equality relation `==` must satisfy the following conditions
/// (for all `a`, `b`, `c` of type `A`, `B`, `C`):
///
/// - **Symmetry**: if `A: PartialEq<B>` and `B: PartialEq<A>`, then **`a == b`
///   implies `b == a`**; and
///
/// - **Transitivity**: if `A: PartialEq<B>` and `B: PartialEq<C>` and `A:
///   PartialEq<C>`, then **`a == b` and `b == c` implies `a == c`**.
///   This must also work for longer chains, such as when `A: PartialEq<B>`, `B: PartialEq<C>`,
///   `C: PartialEq<D>`, and `A: PartialEq<D>` all exist.
///
/// Note that the `B: PartialEq<A>` (symmetric) and `A: PartialEq<C>`
/// (transitive) impls are not forced to exist, but these requirements apply
/// whenever they do exist.
///
/// Violating these requirements is a logic error. The behavior resulting from a logic error is not
/// specified, but users of the trait must ensure that such logic errors do *not* result in
/// undefined behavior. This means that `unsafe` code **must not** rely on the correctness of these
/// methods.
///
/// ## Cross-crate considerations
///
/// Upholding the requirements stated above can become tricky when one crate implements `PartialEq`
/// for a type of another crate (i.e., to allow comparing one of its own types with a type from the
/// standard library). The recommendation is to never implement this trait for a foreign type. In
/// other words, such a crate should do `impl PartialEq<ForeignType> for LocalType`, but it should
/// *not* do `impl PartialEq<LocalType> for ForeignType`.
///
/// This avoids the problem of transitive chains that criss-cross crate boundaries: for all local
/// types `T`, you may assume that no other crate will add `impl`s that allow comparing `T == U`. In
/// other words, if other crates add `impl`s that allow building longer transitive chains `U1 == ...
/// == T == V1 == ...`, then all the types that appear to the right of `T` must be types that the
/// crate defining `T` already knows about. This rules out transitive chains where downstream crates
/// can add new `impl`s that "stitch together" comparisons of foreign types in ways that violate
/// transitivity.
///
/// Not having such foreign `impl`s also avoids forward compatibility issues where one crate adding
/// more `PartialEq` implementations can cause build failures in downstream crates.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`. When `derive`d on structs, two
/// instances are equal if all fields are equal, and not equal if any fields
/// are not equal. When `derive`d on enums, two instances are equal if they
/// are the same variant and all fields are equal.
///
/// ## How can I implement `PartialEq`?
///
/// An example implementation for a domain in which two books are considered
/// the same book if their ISBN matches, even if the formats differ:
///
/// ```
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// struct Book {
///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
///         self.isbn == other.isbn
///     }
/// }
///
/// let b1 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
/// let b2 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Ebook };
/// let b3 = Book { isbn: 10, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
/// assert!(b1 == b2);
/// assert!(b1 != b3);
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I compare two different types?
///
/// The type you can compare with is controlled by `PartialEq`'s type parameter.
/// For example, let's tweak our previous code a bit:
///
/// ```
/// // The derive implements <BookFormat> == <BookFormat> comparisons
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// struct Book {
///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// // Implement <Book> == <BookFormat> comparisons
/// impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &BookFormat) -> bool {
///         self.format == *other
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Implement <BookFormat> == <Book> comparisons
/// impl PartialEq<Book> for BookFormat {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Book) -> bool {
///         *self == other.format
///     }
/// }
///
/// let b1 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
/// assert!(b1 == BookFormat::Paperback);
/// assert!(BookFormat::Ebook != b1);
/// ```
///
/// By changing `impl PartialEq for Book` to `impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book`,
/// we allow `BookFormat`s to be compared with `Book`s.
///
/// A comparison like the one above, which ignores some fields of the struct,
/// can be dangerous. It can easily lead to an unintended violation of the
/// requirements for a partial equivalence relation. For example, if we kept
/// the above implementation of `PartialEq<Book>` for `BookFormat` and added an
/// implementation of `PartialEq<Book>` for `Book` (either via a `#[derive]` or
/// via the manual implementation from the first example) then the result would
/// violate transitivity:
///
/// ```should_panic
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// struct Book {
///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &BookFormat) -> bool {
///         self.format == *other
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq<Book> for BookFormat {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Book) -> bool {
///         *self == other.format
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let b1 = Book { isbn: 1, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///     let b2 = Book { isbn: 2, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
///     assert!(b1 == BookFormat::Paperback);
///     assert!(BookFormat::Paperback == b2);
///
///     // The following should hold by transitivity but doesn't.
///     assert!(b1 == b2); // <-- PANICS

/// Trait for types that form a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order).
///
/// Implementations must be consistent with the [`PartialOrd`] implementation, and ensure `max`,
/// `min`, and `clamp` are consistent with `cmp`:
///
/// - `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(cmp(a, b))`.
/// - `max(a, b) == max_by(a, b, cmp)` (ensured by the default implementation).
/// - `min(a, b) == min_by(a, b, cmp)` (ensured by the default implementation).
/// - For `a.clamp(min, max)`, see the [method docs](#method.clamp) (ensured by the default
///   implementation).
///
/// Violating these requirements is a logic error. The behavior resulting from a logic error is not
/// specified, but users of the trait must ensure that such logic errors do *not* result in
/// undefined behavior. This means that `unsafe` code **must not** rely on the correctness of these
/// methods.
///
/// ## Corollaries
///
/// From the above and the requirements of `PartialOrd`, it follows that for all `a`, `b` and `c`:
///
/// - exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b` or `a > b` is true; and
/// - `<` is transitive: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and
///   `>`.
///
/// Mathematically speaking, the `<` operator defines a strict [weak order]. In cases where `==`
/// conforms to mathematical equality, it also defines a strict [total order].
///
/// [weak order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ordering
/// [total order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`.
///
/// When `derive`d on structs, it will produce a
/// [lexicographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) ordering based on the
/// top-to-bottom declaration order of the struct's members.
///
/// When `derive`d on enums, variants are ordered primarily by their discriminants. Secondarily,
/// they are ordered by their fields. By default, the discriminant is smallest for variants at the
/// top, and largest for variants at the bottom. Here's an example:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
/// enum E {
///     Top,
///     Bottom,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Top < E::Bottom);
/// ```
///
/// However, manually setting the discriminants can override this default behavior:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
/// enum E {
///     Top = 2,
///     Bottom = 1,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Bottom < E::Top);
/// ```
///
/// ## Lexicographical comparison
///
/// Lexicographical comparison is an operation with the following properties:
///  - Two sequences are compared element by element.
///  - The first mismatching element defines which sequence is lexicographically less or greater
///    than the other.
///  - If one sequence is a prefix of another, the shorter sequence is lexicographically less than
///    the other.
///  - If two sequences have equivalent elements and are of the same length, then the sequences are
///    lexicographically equal.
///  - An empty sequence is lexicographically less than any non-empty sequence.
///  - Two empty sequences are lexicographically equal.
///
/// ## How can I implement `Ord`?
///
/// `Ord` requires that the type also be [`PartialOrd`], [`PartialEq`], and [`Eq`].
///
/// Because `Ord` implies a stronger ordering relationship than [`PartialOrd`], and both `Ord` and
/// [`PartialOrd`] must agree, you must choose how to implement `Ord` **first**. You can choose to
/// derive it, or implement it manually. If you derive it, you should derive all four traits. If you
/// implement it manually, you should manually implement all four traits, based on the
/// implementation of `Ord`.
///
/// Here's an example where you want to define the `Character` comparison by `health` and
/// `experience` only, disregarding the field `mana`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cmp::Ordering;
///
/// struct Character {
///     health: u32,
///     experience: u32,
///     mana: f32,
/// }
///
/// impl Ord for Character {
///     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> std::cmp::Ordering {
///         self.experience
///             .cmp(&other.experience)
///             .then(self.health.cmp(&other.health))
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl PartialOrd for Character {
///     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
///         Some(self.cmp(other))
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq for Character {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
///         self.health == other.health && self.experience == other.experience
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl Eq for Character {}
/// ```
///
/// If all you need is to `slice::sort` a type by a field value, it can be simpler to use
/// `slice::sort_by_key`.
///
/// ## Examples of incorrect `Ord` implementations
///
/// ```
/// use std::cmp::Ordering;

/// Trait for types that form a [partial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order).
///
/// The `lt`, `le`, `gt`, and `ge` methods of this trait can be called using the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and
/// `>=` operators, respectively.
///
/// This trait should **only** contain the comparison logic for a type **if one plans on only
/// implementing `PartialOrd` but not [`Ord`]**. Otherwise the comparison logic should be in [`Ord`]
/// and this trait implemented with `Some(self.cmp(other))`.
///
/// The methods of this trait must be consistent with each other and with those of [`PartialEq`].
/// The following conditions must hold:
///
/// 1. `a == b` if and only if `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(Equal)`.
/// 2. `a < b` if and only if `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(Less)`
/// 3. `a > b` if and only if `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(Greater)`
/// 4. `a <= b` if and only if `a < b || a == b`
/// 5. `a >= b` if and only if `a > b || a == b`
/// 6. `a != b` if and only if `!(a == b)`.
///
/// Conditions 2–5 above are ensured by the default implementation. Condition 6 is already ensured
/// by [`PartialEq`].
///
/// If [`Ord`] is also implemented for `Self` and `Rhs`, it must also be consistent with
/// `partial_cmp` (see the documentation of that trait for the exact requirements). It's easy to
/// accidentally make them disagree by deriving some of the traits and manually implementing others.
///
/// The comparison relations must satisfy the following conditions (for all `a`, `b`, `c` of type
/// `A`, `B`, `C`):
///
/// - **Transitivity**: if `A: PartialOrd<B>` and `B: PartialOrd<C>` and `A: PartialOrd<C>`, then `a
///   < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`. This must also
///   work for longer chains, such as when `A: PartialOrd<B>`, `B: PartialOrd<C>`, `C:
///   PartialOrd<D>`, and `A: PartialOrd<D>` all exist.
/// - **Duality**: if `A: PartialOrd<B>` and `B: PartialOrd<A>`, then `a < b` if and only if `b >
///   a`.
///
/// Note that the `B: PartialOrd<A>` (dual) and `A: PartialOrd<C>` (transitive) impls are not forced
/// to exist, but these requirements apply whenever they do exist.
///
/// Violating these requirements is a logic error. The behavior resulting from a logic error is not
/// specified, but users of the trait must ensure that such logic errors do *not* result in
/// undefined behavior. This means that `unsafe` code **must not** rely on the correctness of these
/// methods.
///
/// ## Cross-crate considerations
///
/// Upholding the requirements stated above can become tricky when one crate implements `PartialOrd`
/// for a type of another crate (i.e., to allow comparing one of its own types with a type from the
/// standard library). The recommendation is to never implement this trait for a foreign type. In
/// other words, such a crate should do `impl PartialOrd<ForeignType> for LocalType`, but it should
/// *not* do `impl PartialOrd<LocalType> for ForeignType`.
///
/// This avoids the problem of transitive chains that criss-cross crate boundaries: for all local
/// types `T`, you may assume that no other crate will add `impl`s that allow comparing `T < U`. In
/// other words, if other crates add `impl`s that allow building longer transitive chains `U1 < ...
/// < T < V1 < ...`, then all the types that appear to the right of `T` must be types that the crate
/// defining `T` already knows about. This rules out transitive chains where downstream crates can
/// add new `impl`s that "stitch together" comparisons of foreign types in ways that violate
/// transitivity.
///
/// Not having such foreign `impl`s also avoids forward compatibility issues where one crate adding
/// more `PartialOrd` implementations can cause build failures in downstream crates.
///
/// ## Corollaries
///
/// The following corollaries follow from the above requirements:
///
/// - irreflexivity of `<` and `>`: `!(a < a)`, `!(a > a)`
/// - transitivity of `>`: if `a > b` and `b > c` then `a > c`
/// - duality of `partial_cmp`: `partial_cmp(a, b) == partial_cmp(b, a).map(Ordering::reverse)`
///
/// ## Strict and non-strict partial orders
///
/// The `<` and `>` operators behave according to a *strict* partial order. However, `<=` and `>=`
/// do **not** behave according to a *non-strict* partial order. That is because mathematically, a
/// non-strict partial order would require reflexivity, i.e. `a <= a` would need to be true for
/// every `a`. This isn't always the case for types that implement `PartialOrd`, for example:
///
/// ```
/// let a = f64::sqrt(-1.0);
/// assert_eq!(a <= a, false);
/// ```
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`.
///
/// When `derive`d on structs, it will produce a
/// [lexicographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) ordering based on the
/// top-to-bottom declaration order of the struct's members.
///
/// When `derive`d on enums, variants are primarily ordered by their discriminants. Secondarily,
/// they are ordered by their fields. By default, the discriminant is smallest for variants at the
/// top, and largest for variants at the bottom. Here's an example:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
/// enum E {
///     Top,
///     Bottom,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Top < E::Bottom);
/// ```
///
/// However, manually setting the discriminants can override this default behavior:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
/// enum E {
///     Top = 2,
///     Bottom = 1,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Bottom < E::Top);
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I implement `PartialOrd`?
///
/// `PartialOrd` only requires implementation of the [`partial_cmp`] method, with the others
/// generated from default implementations.
///
/// However it remains possible to implement the others separately for types which do not have a
/// total order. For example, for floating point numbers, `NaN < 0 == false` and `NaN >= 0 == false`
/// (cf. IEEE 754-2008 section 5.11).
///
/// `PartialOrd` requires your type to be [`PartialEq`].
///
/// If your type is [`Ord`], you can implement [`partial_cmp`] by using [`cmp`]:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cmp::Ordering;
///
/// struct Person {
///     id: u32,
///     name: String,
///     height: u32,
/// }
///
/// impl PartialOrd for Person {
///     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
///         Some(self.cmp(other))
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl Ord for Person {
///     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
///         self.height.cmp(&other.height)
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq for Person {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
///         self.height == other.height
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl Eq for Person {}
/// ```
///
/// You may also find it useful to use [`partial_cmp`] on your type's fields. Here is an example of
/// `Person` types who have a floating-point `height` field that is the only field to be used for
/// sorting:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cmp::Ordering;
///
/// struct Person {
///     id: u32,
///     name: String,
///     height: f64,
/// }
///
/// impl PartialOrd for Person {
///     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
///         self.height.partial_cmp(&other.height)
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl PartialEq for Person {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
///         self.height == other.height
///     }
/// }
/// ```
