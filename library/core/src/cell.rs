//! Shareable mutable containers.
//!
//! Rust memory safety is based on this rule: Given an object `T`, it is only possible to
//! have one of the following:
//!
//! - Several immutable references (`&T`) to the object (also known as **aliasing**).
//! - One mutable reference (`&mut T`) to the object (also known as **mutability**).
//!
//! This is enforced by the Rust compiler. However, there are situations where this rule is not
//! flexible enough. Sometimes it is required to have multiple references to an object and yet
//! mutate it.
//!
//! Shareable mutable containers exist to permit mutability in a controlled manner, even in the
//! presence of aliasing. [`Cell<T>`], [`RefCell<T>`], and [`OnceCell<T>`] allow doing this in
//! a single-threaded wayâ€”they do not implement [`Sync`]. (If you need to do aliasing and
//! mutation among multiple threads, [`Mutex<T>`], [`RwLock<T>`], [`OnceLock<T>`] or [`atomic`]
//! types are the correct data structures to do so).
//!
//! Values of the `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>`, and `OnceCell<T>` types may be mutated through shared
//! references (i.e. the common `&T` type), whereas most Rust types can only be mutated through
//! unique (`&mut T`) references. We say these cell types provide 'interior mutability'
//! (mutable via `&T`), in contrast with typical Rust types that exhibit 'inherited mutability'
//! (mutable only via `&mut T`).
//!
//! Cell types come in three flavors: `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>`, and `OnceCell<T>`. Each provides
//! a different way of providing safe interior mutability.
//!
//! ## `Cell<T>`
//!
//! [`Cell<T>`] implements interior mutability by moving values in and out of the cell. That is, an
//! `&mut T` to the inner value can never be obtained, and the value itself cannot be directly
//! obtained without replacing it with something else. Both of these rules ensure that there is
//! never more than one reference pointing to the inner value. This type provides the following
//! methods:
//!
//!  - For types that implement [`Copy`], the [`get`](Cell::get) method retrieves the current
//!    interior value by duplicating it.
//!  - For types that implement [`Default`], the [`take`](Cell::take) method replaces the current
//!    interior value with [`Default::default()`] and returns the replaced value.
//!  - All types have:
//!    - [`replace`](Cell::replace): replaces the current interior value and returns the replaced
//!      value.
//!    - [`into_inner`](Cell::into_inner): this method consumes the `Cell<T>` and returns the
//!      interior value.
//!    - [`set`](Cell::set): this method replaces the interior value, dropping the replaced value.
//!
//! `Cell<T>` is typically used for more simple types where copying or moving values isn't too
//! resource intensive (e.g. numbers), and should usually be preferred over other cell types when
//! possible. For larger and non-copy types, `RefCell` provides some advantages.
//!
//! ## `RefCell<T>`
//!
//! [`RefCell<T>`] uses Rust's lifetimes to implement "dynamic borrowing", a process whereby one can
//! claim temporary, exclusive, mutable access to the inner value. Borrows for `RefCell<T>`s are
//! tracked at _runtime_, unlike Rust's native reference types which are entirely tracked
//! statically, at compile time.
//!
//! An immutable reference to a `RefCell`'s inner value (`&T`) can be obtained with
//! [`borrow`](`RefCell::borrow`), and a mutable borrow (`&mut T`) can be obtained with
//! [`borrow_mut`](`RefCell::borrow_mut`). When these functions are called, they first verify that
//! Rust's borrow rules will be satisfied: any number of immutable borrows are allowed or a
//! single mutable borrow is allowed, but never both. If a borrow is attempted that would violate
//! these rules, the thread will panic.
//!
//! The corresponding [`Sync`] version of `RefCell<T>` is [`RwLock<T>`].
//!
//! ## `OnceCell<T>`
//!
//! [`OnceCell<T>`] is somewhat of a hybrid of `Cell` and `RefCell` that works for values that
//! typically only need to be set once. This means that a reference `&T` can be obtained without
//! moving or copying the inner value (unlike `Cell`) but also without runtime checks (unlike
//! `RefCell`). However, its value can also not be updated once set unless you have a mutable
//! reference to the `OnceCell`.
//!
//! `OnceCell` provides the following methods:
//!
//! - [`get`](OnceCell::get): obtain a reference to the inner value
//! - [`set`](OnceCell::set): set the inner value if it is unset (returns a `Result`)
//! - [`get_or_init`](OnceCell::get_or_init): return the inner value, initializing it if needed
//! - [`get_mut`](OnceCell::get_mut): provide a mutable reference to the inner value, only available
//!   if you have a mutable reference to the cell itself.
//!
//! The corresponding [`Sync`] version of `OnceCell<T>` is [`OnceLock<T>`].
//!
//! ## `LazyCell<T, F>`
//!
//! A common pattern with OnceCell is, for a given OnceCell, to use the same function on every
//! call to [`OnceCell::get_or_init`] with that cell. This is what is offered by [`LazyCell`],
//! which pairs cells of `T` with functions of `F`, and always calls `F` before it yields `&T`.
//! This happens implicitly by simply attempting to dereference the LazyCell to get its contents,
//! so its use is much more transparent with a place which has been initialized by a constant.
//!
//! More complicated patterns that don't fit this description can be built on `OnceCell<T>` instead.
//!
//! `LazyCell` works by providing an implementation of `impl Deref` that calls the function,
//! so you can just use it by dereference (e.g. `*lazy_cell` or `lazy_cell.deref()`).
//!
//! The corresponding [`Sync`] version of `LazyCell<T, F>` is [`LazyLock<T, F>`].
//!
//! # When to choose interior mutability
//!
//! The more common inherited mutability, where one must have unique access to mutate a value, is
//! one of the key language elements that enables Rust to reason strongly about pointer aliasing,
//! statically preventing crash bugs. Because of that, inherited mutability is preferred, and
//! interior mutability is something of a last resort. Since cell types enable mutation where it
//! would otherwise be disallowed though, there are occasions when interior mutability might be
//! appropriate, or even *must* be used, e.g.
//!
//! * Introducing mutability 'inside' of something immutable
//! * Implementation details of logically-immutable methods.
//! * Mutating implementations of [`Clone`].
//!
//! ## Introducing mutability 'inside' of something immutable
//!
//! Many shared smart pointer types, including [`Rc<T>`] and [`Arc<T>`], provide containers that can
//! be cloned and shared between multiple parties. Because the contained values may be
//! multiply-aliased, they can only be borrowed with `&`, not `&mut`. Without cells it would be
//! impossible to mutate data inside of these smart pointers at all.
//!
//! It's very common then to put a `RefCell<T>` inside shared pointer types to reintroduce
//! mutability:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let shared_map: Rc<RefCell<_>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
//!     // Create a new block to limit the scope of the dynamic borrow
//!     {
//!         let mut map: RefMut<'_, _> = shared_map.borrow_mut();
//!         map.insert("africa", 92388);
//!         map.insert("kyoto", 11837);
//!         map.insert("piccadilly", 11826);
//!         map.insert("marbles", 38);
//!     }
//!
//!     // Note that if we had not let the previous borrow of the cache fall out
//!     // of scope then the subsequent borrow would cause a dynamic thread panic.
//!     // This is the major hazard of using `RefCell`.
//!     let total: i32 = shared_map.borrow().values().sum();
//!     println!("{total}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that this example uses `Rc<T>` and not `Arc<T>`. `RefCell<T>`s are for single-threaded
//! scenarios. Consider using [`RwLock<T>`] or [`Mutex<T>`] if you need shared mutability in a
//! multi-threaded situation.
//!
//! ## Implementation details of logically-immutable methods
//!
//! Occasionally it may be desirable not to expose in an API that there is mutation happening
//! "under the hood". This may be because logically the operation is immutable, but e.g., caching
//! forces the implementation to perform mutation; or because you must employ mutation to implement
//! a trait method that was originally defined to take `&self`.
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(dead_code)]
//! use std::cell::OnceCell;
//!
//! struct Graph {
//!     edges: Vec<(i32, i32)>,
//!     span_tree_cache: OnceCell<Vec<(i32, i32)>>
//! }
//!
//! impl Graph {
//!     fn minimum_spanning_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {
//!         self.span_tree_cache
//!             .get_or_init(|| self.calc_span_tree())
//!             .clone()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn calc_span_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {
//!         // Expensive computation goes here
//!         vec![]
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Mutating implementations of `Clone`
//!
//! This is simply a special - but common - case of the previous: hiding mutability for operations
//! that appear to be immutable. The [`clone`](Clone::clone) method is expected to not change the
//! source value, and is declared to take `&self`, not `&mut self`. Therefore, any mutation that
//! happens in the `clone` method must use cell types. For example, [`Rc<T>`] maintains its
//! reference counts within a `Cell<T>`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::Cell;
//! use std::ptr::NonNull;
//! use std::process::abort;
//! use std::marker::PhantomData;
//!
//! struct Rc<T: ?Sized> {
//!     ptr: NonNull<RcInner<T>>,

//!     strong: Cell<usize>,
//!     refcount: Cell<usize>,

//!             phantom: PhantomData,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! trait RcInnerPtr<T: ?Sized> {
//!
//!     fn inner(&self) -> &RcInner<T>;
//!
//!     fn strong(&self) -> usize {
//!         self.inner().strong.get()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn inc_strong(&self) {
//!         self.inner()
//!             .strong
//!             .set(self.strong()

/// The core primitive for interior mutability in Rust.
///
/// If you have a reference `&T`, then normally in Rust the compiler performs optimizations based on
/// the knowledge that `&T` points to immutable data. Mutating that data, for example through an
/// alias or by transmuting a `&T` into a `&mut T`, is considered undefined behavior.
/// `UnsafeCell<T>` opts-out of the immutability guarantee for `&T`: a shared reference
/// `&UnsafeCell<T>` may point to data that is being mutated. This is called "interior mutability".
///
/// All other types that allow internal mutability, such as [`Cell<T>`] and [`RefCell<T>`], internally
/// use `UnsafeCell` to wrap their data.
///
/// Note that only the immutability guarantee for shared references is affected by `UnsafeCell`. The
/// uniqueness guarantee for mutable references is unaffected. There is *no* legal way to obtain
/// aliasing `&mut`, not even with `UnsafeCell<T>`.
///
/// `UnsafeCell` does nothing to avoid data races; they are still undefined behavior. If multiple
/// threads have access to the same `UnsafeCell`, they must follow the usual rules of the
/// [concurrent memory model]: conflicting non-synchronized accesses must be done via the APIs in
/// [`core::sync::atomic`].
///
/// The `UnsafeCell` API itself is technically very simple: [`.get()`] gives you a raw pointer
/// `*mut T` to its contents. It is up to _you_ as the abstraction designer to use that raw pointer
/// correctly.
///
/// [`.get()`]: `UnsafeCell::get`
/// [concurrent memory model]: ../sync/atomic/index.html#memory-model-for-atomic-accesses
///
/// The precise Rust aliasing rules are somewhat in flux, but the main points are not contentious:
///
/// - If you create a safe reference with lifetime `'a` (either a `&T` or `&mut T` reference), then
/// you must not access the data in any way that contradicts that reference for the remainder of
/// `'a`. For example, this means that if you take the `*mut T` from an `UnsafeCell<T>` and cast it
/// to an `&T`, then the data in `T` must remain immutable (modulo any `UnsafeCell` data found
/// within `T`, of course) until that reference's lifetime expires. Similarly, if you create a `&mut
/// T` reference that is released to safe code, then you must not access the data within the
/// `UnsafeCell` until that reference expires.
///
/// - For both `&T` without `UnsafeCell<_>` and `&mut T`, you must also not deallocate the data
/// until the reference expires. As a special exception, given an `&T`, any part of it that is
/// inside an `UnsafeCell<_>` may be deallocated during the lifetime of the reference, after the
/// last time the reference is used (dereferenced or reborrowed). Since you cannot deallocate a part
/// of what a reference points to, this means the memory an `&T` points to can be deallocated only if
/// *every part of it* (including padding) is inside an `UnsafeCell`.
///
///     However, whenever a `&UnsafeCell<T>` is constructed or dereferenced, it must still point to
/// live memory and the compiler is allowed to insert spurious reads if it can prove that this
/// memory has not yet been deallocated.
///
/// To assist with proper design, the following scenarios are explicitly declared legal
/// for single-threaded code:
///
/// 1. A `&T` reference can be released to safe code and there it can co-exist with other `&T`
/// references, but not with a `&mut T`
///
/// 2. A `&mut T` reference may be released to safe code provided neither other `&mut T` nor `&T`
/// co-exist with it. A `&mut T` must always be unique.
///
/// Note that whilst mutating the contents of an `&UnsafeCell<T>` (even while other
/// `&UnsafeCell<T>` references alias the cell) is
/// ok (provided you enforce the above invariants some other way), it is still undefined behavior
/// to have multiple `&mut UnsafeCell<T>` aliases. That is, `UnsafeCell` is a wrapper
/// designed to have a special interaction with _shared_ accesses (_i.e._, through an
/// `&UnsafeCell<_>` reference); there is no magic whatsoever when dealing with _exclusive_
/// accesses (_e.g._, through a `&mut UnsafeCell<_>`): neither the cell nor the wrapped value
/// may be aliased for the duration of that `&mut` borrow.
/// This is showcased by the [`.get_mut()`] accessor, which is a _safe_ getter that yields
/// a `&mut T`.
///
/// [`.get_mut()`]: `UnsafeCell::get_mut`
///
/// # Memory layout
///
/// `UnsafeCell<T>` has the same in-memory representation as its inner type `T`. A consequence
/// of this guarantee is that it is possible to convert between `T` and `UnsafeCell<T>`.
/// Special care has to be taken when converting a nested `T` inside of an `Outer<T>` type
/// to an `Outer<UnsafeCell<T>>` type: this is not sound when the `Outer<T>` type enables [niche]
/// optimizations. For example, the type `Option<NonNull<u8>>` is typically 8 bytes large on
/// 64-bit platforms, but the type `Option<UnsafeCell<NonNull<u8>>>` takes up 16 bytes of space.
/// Therefore this is not a valid conversion, despite `NonNull<u8>` and `UnsafeCell<NonNull<u8>>>`
/// having the same memory layout. This is because `UnsafeCell` disables niche optimizations in
/// order to avoid its interior mutability property from spreading from `T` into the `Outer` type,
/// thus this can cause distortions in the type size in these cases.
///
/// Note that the only valid way to obtain a `*mut T` pointer to the contents of a
/// _shared_ `UnsafeCell<T>` is through [`.get()`]  or [`.raw_get()`]. A `&mut T` reference
/// can be obtained by either dereferencing this pointer or by calling [`.get_mut()`]
/// on an _exclusive_ `UnsafeCell<T>`. Even though `T` and `UnsafeCell<T>` have the
/// same memory layout, the following is not allowed and undefined behavior:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// # use std::cell::UnsafeCell;
/// unsafe fn not_allowed<T>(ptr: &UnsafeCell<T>) -> &mut T {
///   let t = ptr as *const UnsafeCell<T> as *mut T;
///   // This is undefined behavior, because the `*mut T` pointer
///   // was not obtained through `.get()` nor `.raw_get()`:
///   unsafe { &mut *t }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Instead, do this:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::cell::UnsafeCell;
/// // Safety: the caller must ensure that there are no references that
/// // point to the *contents* of the `UnsafeCell`.
/// unsafe fn get_mut<T>(ptr: &UnsafeCell<T>) -> &mut T {
///   unsafe { &mut *ptr.get() }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Converting in the other direction from a `&mut T`
/// to an `&UnsafeCell<T>` is allowed:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::cell::UnsafeCell;
/// fn get_shared<T>(ptr: &mut T) -> &UnsafeCell<T> {
///   let t = ptr as *mut T as *const UnsafeCell<T>;
///   // SAFETY: `T` and `UnsafeCell<T>` have the same memory layout
///   unsafe { &*t }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [niche]: https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#niche
/// [`.raw_get()`]: `UnsafeCell::raw_get`
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here is an example showcasing how to soundly mutate the contents of an `UnsafeCell<_>` despite
/// there being multiple references aliasing the cell:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cell::UnsafeCell;
///
/// let x: UnsafeCell<i32> = 42.into();
/// // Get multiple / concurrent / shared references to the same `x`.
/// let (p1, p2): (&UnsafeCell<i32>, &UnsafeCell<i32>) = (&x, &x);
///
/// unsafe {
///     // SAFETY: within this scope there are no other references to `x`'s contents,
///     // so ours is effectively unique.
///     let p1_exclusive: &mut i32 = &mut *p1.get(); // -- borrow --+
///     *p1_exclusive += 27; //                                     |
/// } // <---------- cannot go beyond this point -------------------+
///
/// unsafe {
///     // SAFETY: within this scope nobody expects to have exclusive access to `x`'s contents,
///     // so we can have multiple shared accesses concurrently.
///     let p2_shared: &i32 = &*p2.get();
///     assert_eq!(*p2_shared, 42 + 27);
///     let p1_shared: &i32 = &*p1.get();
///     assert_eq!(*p1_shared, *p2_shared);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The following example showcases the fact that exclusive access to an `UnsafeCell<T>`

///
/// ```rust
/// #![forbid(unsafe_code)] // with exclusive accesses,
///                         // `UnsafeCell` is a transparent no-op wrapper,
