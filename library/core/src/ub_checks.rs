//! Provides the [`assert_unsafe_precondition`] macro as well as some utility functions that cover
//! common preconditions.

use crate::intrinsics::{self, const_eval_select};

/// Checks that the preconditions of an unsafe function are followed.
///
/// The check is enabled at runtime if debug assertions are enabled when the
/// caller is monomorphized. In const-eval/Miri checks implemented with this
/// macro for language UB are always ignored.
///
/// This macro should be called as
/// `assert_unsafe_precondition!(check_{library,language}_ub, "message", (ident: type = expr, ident: type = expr) => check_expr)`
/// where each `expr` will be evaluated and passed in as function argument `ident: type`. Then all
/// those arguments are passed to a function with the body `check_expr`.
/// Pick `check_language_ub` when this is guarding a violation of language UB, i.e., immediate UB
/// according to the Rust Abstract Machine. Pick `check_library_ub` when this is guarding a violation
/// of a documented library precondition that does not *immediately* lead to language UB.
///
/// If `check_library_ub` is used but the check is actually guarding language UB, the check will
/// slow down const-eval/Miri and we'll get the panic message instead of the interpreter's nice
/// diagnostic, but our ability to detect UB is unchanged.
/// But if `check_language_ub` is used when the check is actually for library UB, the check is
/// omitted in const-eval/Miri and thus if we eventually execute language UB which relies on the
/// library UB, the backtrace Miri reports may be far removed from original cause.
///
/// These checks are behind a condition which is evaluated at codegen time, not expansion time like
/// [`debug_assert`]. This means that a standard library built with optimizations and debug
/// assertions disabled will have these checks optimized out of its monomorphizations, but if a
/// caller of the standard library has debug assertions enabled and monomorphizes an expansion of
/// this macro, that monomorphization will contain the check.
///
/// Since these checks cannot be optimized out in MIR, some care must be taken in both call and
/// implementation to mitigate their compile-time overhead. Calls to this macro always expand to
/// this structure:
/// ```ignore (pseudocode)
/// if ::core::intrinsics::check_language_ub() {
///     precondition_check(args)
/// }
/// ```
/// where `precondition_check` is monomorphic with the attributes `#[rustc_nounwind]`, `#[inline]` and
/// `#[rustc_no_mir_inline]`. This combination of attributes ensures that the actual check logic is
/// compiled only once and generates a minimal amount of IR because the check cannot be inlined in
/// MIR, but *can* be inlined and fully optimized by a codegen backend.
///
/// Callers should avoid introducing any other `let` bindings or any code outside this macro in
/// order to call it. Since the precompiled standard library is built with full debuginfo and these
/// variables cannot be optimized out in MIR, an innocent-looking `let` can produce enough
/// debuginfo to have a measurable compile-time impact on debug builds.
