/// The `?` operator and `try {}` blocks.
///
/// `try_*` methods typically involve a type implementing this trait.  For
/// example, the closures passed to [`Iterator::try_fold`] and
/// [`Iterator::try_for_each`] must return such a type.
///
/// `Try` types are typically those containing two or more categories of values,
/// some subset of which are so commonly handled via early returns that it's
/// worth providing a terse (but still visible) syntax to make that easy.
///
/// This is most often seen for error handling with [`Result`] and [`Option`].
/// The quintessential implementation of this trait is on [`ControlFlow`].
///
/// # Using `Try` in Generic Code
///
/// `Iterator::try_fold` was stabilized to call back in Rust 1.27, but
/// this trait is much newer.  To illustrate the various associated types and
/// methods, let's implement our own version.
///
/// As a reminder, an infallible version of a fold looks something like this:
/// ```
/// fn simple_fold<A, T>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> A,
/// ) -> A {
///     for x in iter {
///         accum = f(accum, x);
///     }
///     accum
/// }
/// ```
///
/// So instead of `f` returning just an `A`, we'll need it to return some other
/// type that produces an `A` in the "don't short circuit" path.  Conveniently,
/// that's also the type we need to return from the function.
///
/// Let's add a new generic parameter `R` for that type, and bound it to the
/// output type that we want:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::Try;
/// fn simple_try_fold_1<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     todo!()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If we get through the entire iterator, we need to wrap up the accumulator
/// into the return type using [`Try::from_output`]:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::{ControlFlow, Try};
/// fn simple_try_fold_2<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     for x in iter {
///         let cf = f(accum, x).branch();
///         match cf {
///             ControlFlow::Continue(a) => accum = a,
///             ControlFlow::Break(_) => todo!(),
///         }
///     }
///     R::from_output(accum)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We'll also need [`FromResidual::from_residual`] to turn the residual back
/// into the original type.  But because it's a supertrait of `Try`, we don't
/// need to mention it in the bounds.  All types which implement `Try` can be
/// recreated from their corresponding residual, so we'll just call it:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::{ControlFlow, Try};
/// pub fn simple_try_fold_3<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     for x in iter {
///         let cf = f(accum, x).branch();
///         match cf {
///             ControlFlow::Continue(a) => accum = a,
///             ControlFlow::Break(r) => return R::from_residual(r),
///         }
///     }
///     R::from_output(accum)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// But this "call `branch`, then `match` on it, and `return` if it was a
/// `Break`" is exactly what happens inside the `?` operator.  So rather than
/// do all this manually, we can just use `?` instead:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::Try;
/// fn simple_try_fold<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     for x in iter {
///         accum = f(accum, x)?;
///     }
///     R::from_output(accum)
/// }
