/// mutable deref coercion similarly occurs.
///
/// **Warning:** Deref coercion is a powerful language feature which has
/// far-reaching implications for every type that implements `Deref`. The
/// compiler will silently insert calls to `Deref::deref`. For this reason, one
/// should be careful about implementing `Deref` and only do so when deref
/// coercion is desirable. See [below][implementing] for advice on when this is
/// typically desirable or undesirable.
///
/// Types that implement `Deref` or `DerefMut` are often called "smart
/// pointers" and the mechanism of deref coercion has been specifically designed
/// to facilitate the pointer-like behavior that name suggests. Often, the
/// purpose of a "smart pointer" type is to change the ownership semantics
/// of a contained value (for example, [`Rc`][rc] or [`Cow`][cow]) or the
/// storage semantics of a contained value (for example, [`Box`][box]).
///
/// # Deref coercion
///
/// If `T` implements `Deref<Target = U>`, and `v` is a value of type `T`, then:
///
/// * In immutable contexts, `*v` (where `T` is neither a reference nor a raw
///   pointer) is equivalent to `*Deref::deref(&v)`.
/// * Values of type `&T` are coerced to values of type `&U`
/// * `T` implicitly implements all the methods of the type `U` which take the
///   `&self` receiver.
///
/// For more details, visit [the chapter in *The Rust Programming Language*][book]
/// as well as the reference sections on [the dereference operator][ref-deref-op],
/// [method resolution], and [type coercions].
///
/// # When to implement `Deref` or `DerefMut`
///
/// The same advice applies to both deref traits. In general, deref traits
/// **should** be implemented if:
///
/// 1. a value of the type transparently behaves like a value of the target
///    type;
/// 1. the implementation of the deref function is cheap; and
/// 1. users of the type will not be surprised by any deref coercion behavior.
///
/// In general, deref traits **should not** be implemented if:
///
/// 1. the deref implementations could fail unexpectedly; or
/// 1. the type has methods that are likely to collide with methods on the
///    target type; or
/// 1. committing to deref coercion as part of the public API is not desirable.
///
/// Note that there's a large difference between implementing deref traits
/// generically over many target types, and doing so only for specific target
/// types.
///
/// Generic implementations, such as for [`Box<T>`][box] (which is generic over
/// every type and dereferences to `T`) should be careful to provide few or no
/// methods, since the target type is unknown and therefore every method could
/// collide with one on the target type, causing confusion for users.
/// `impl<T> Box<T>` has no methods (though several associated functions),
/// partly for this reason.
///
/// Specific implementations, such as for [`String`][string] (whose `Deref`
/// implementation has `Target = str`) can have many methods, since avoiding
/// collision is much easier. `String` and `str` both have many methods, and
/// `String` additionally behaves as if it has every method of `str` because of
/// deref coercion. The implementing type may also be generic while the
/// implementation is still specific in this sense; for example, [`Vec<T>`][vec]
/// dereferences to `[T]`, so methods of `T` are not applicable.
///
/// Consider also that deref coercion means that deref traits are a much larger
/// part of a type's public API than any other trait as it is implicitly called
/// by the compiler. Therefore, it is advisable to consider whether this is
/// something you are comfortable supporting as a public API.
///
/// The [`AsRef`] and [`Borrow`][core::borrow::Borrow] traits have very similar
/// signatures to `Deref`. It may be desirable to implement either or both of
/// these, whether in addition to or rather than deref traits. See their
/// documentation for details.
///
/// # Fallibility
///
/// **This trait's method should never unexpectedly fail**. Deref coercion means
/// the compiler will often insert calls to `Deref::deref` implicitly. Failure
/// during dereferencing can be extremely confusing when `Deref` is invoked
/// implicitly. In the majority of uses it should be infallible, though it may
/// be acceptable to panic if the type is misused through programmer error, for
/// example.
///
/// However, infallibility is not enforced and therefore not guaranteed.
/// As such, `unsafe` code should not rely on infallibility in general for
/// soundness.
