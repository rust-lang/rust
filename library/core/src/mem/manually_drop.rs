/// A wrapper to inhibit the compiler from automatically calling `T`â€™s
/// destructor. This wrapper is 0-cost.
///
/// `ManuallyDrop<T>` is guaranteed to have the same layout and bit validity as
/// `T`, and is subject to the same layout optimizations as `T`. As a
/// consequence, it has *no effect* on the assumptions that the compiler makes
/// about its contents. For example, initializing a `ManuallyDrop<&mut T>` with
/// [`mem::zeroed`] is undefined behavior. If you need to handle uninitialized
/// data, use [`MaybeUninit<T>`] instead.
///
/// Note that accessing the value inside a `ManuallyDrop<T>` is safe. This means
/// that a `ManuallyDrop<T>` whose content has been dropped must not be exposed
/// through a public safe API. Correspondingly, `ManuallyDrop::drop` is unsafe.
///
/// # `ManuallyDrop` and drop order
///
/// Rust has a well-defined [drop order] of values. To make sure that fields or
/// locals are dropped in a specific order, reorder the declarations such that
/// the implicit drop order is the correct one.
///
/// It is possible to use `ManuallyDrop` to control the drop order, but this
/// requires unsafe code and is hard to do correctly in the presence of
/// unwinding.
///
/// For example, if you want to make sure that a specific field is dropped after
/// the others, make it the last field of a struct:
///
/// ```
/// struct Context;
///
/// struct Widget {
///     children: Vec<Widget>,
///     // `context` will be dropped after `children`.
///     // Rust guarantees that fields are dropped in the order of declaration.
///     context: Context,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Interaction with `Box`
///
/// Currently, if you have a `ManuallyDrop<T>`, where the type `T` is a `Box` or
/// contains a `Box` inside, then dropping the `T` followed by moving the
/// `ManuallyDrop<T>` is [considered to be undefined
/// behavior](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/245).
/// That is, the following code causes undefined behavior:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;
///
/// let mut x = ManuallyDrop::new(Box::new(42));
/// unsafe {
///     ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut x);
/// }
/// let y = x; // Undefined behavior!
/// ```
///
/// This is [likely to change in the
/// future](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3336-maybe-dangling.html). In the
/// meantime, consider using [`MaybeUninit`] instead.
///
/// # Safety hazards when storing `ManuallyDrop` in a struct or an enum.
///
/// Special care is needed when all of the conditions below are met:
/// * A struct or enum contains a `ManuallyDrop`.
/// * The `ManuallyDrop` is not inside a `union`.
/// * The struct or enum is part of public API, or is stored in a struct or an
///   enum that is part of public API.
/// * There is code that drops the contents of the `ManuallyDrop` field, and
///   this code is outside the struct or enum's `Drop` implementation.
///
/// In particular, the following hazards may occur:
///
/// #### Storing generic types
///
/// If the `ManuallyDrop` contains a client-supplied generic type, the client
/// might provide a `Box` as that type. This would cause undefined behavior when
/// the struct or enum is later moved, as mentioned in the previous section. For
/// example, the following code causes undefined behavior:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;
///
/// pub struct BadOption<T> {
///     // Invariant: Has been dropped iff `is_some` is false.
///     value: ManuallyDrop<T>,
///     is_some: bool,
/// }
/// impl<T> BadOption<T> {
///     pub fn new(value: T) -> Self {
///         Self { value: ManuallyDrop::new(value), is_some: true }
///     }
///     pub fn change_to_none(&mut self) {
///         if self.is_some {
///             self.is_some = false;
///             unsafe {
///                 // SAFETY: `value` hasn't been dropped yet, as per the invariant
///                 // (This is actually unsound!)
///                 ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut self.value);
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // In another crate:
///
/// let mut option = BadOption::new(Box::new(42));
/// option.change_to_none();
/// let option2 = option; // Undefined behavior!
/// ```
///
/// #### Deriving traits
///
/// Deriving `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`, or `Hash` on
/// the struct or enum could be unsound, since the derived implementations of
/// these traits would access the `ManuallyDrop` field. For example, the
/// following code causes undefined behavior:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;
///
/// // This derive is unsound in combination with the `ManuallyDrop::drop` call.
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct Foo {
///     value: ManuallyDrop<String>,
/// }
/// impl Foo {
///     pub fn new() -> Self {
///         let mut temp = Self {
///             value: ManuallyDrop::new(String::from("Unsafe rust is hard."))
///         };
///         unsafe {
///             // SAFETY: `value` hasn't been dropped yet.
///             ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut temp.value);
///         }
///         temp
///     }
/// }
///
/// // In another crate:
///
/// let foo = Foo::new();
/// println!("{:?}", foo); // Undefined behavior!
/// ```
