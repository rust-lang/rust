use crate::marker::{ConstParamTy_, UnsizedConstParamTy};

/// Marks that `Src` is transmutable into `Self`.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// This trait cannot be implemented explicitly. It is implemented on-the-fly by
/// the compiler for all types `Src` and `Self` such that, given a set of safety
/// obligations on the programmer (see [`Assume`]), the compiler has proved that
/// the bits of a value of type `Src` can be soundly reinterpreted as a `Self`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// If `Dst: TransmuteFrom<Src, ASSUMPTIONS>`, the compiler guarantees that
/// `Src` is soundly *union-transmutable* into a value of type `Dst`, provided
/// that the programmer has guaranteed that the given [`ASSUMPTIONS`](Assume)
/// are satisfied.
///
/// A union-transmute is any bit-reinterpretation conversion in the form of:
///
/// ```rust
/// pub unsafe fn transmute_via_union<Src, Dst>(src: Src) -> Dst {
///     use core::mem::ManuallyDrop;
///
///     #[repr(C)]
///     union Transmute<Src, Dst> {
///         src: ManuallyDrop<Src>,
///         dst: ManuallyDrop<Dst>,
///     }
///
///     let transmute = Transmute {
///         src: ManuallyDrop::new(src),
///     };
///
///     let dst = transmute.dst;
///
///     ManuallyDrop::into_inner(dst)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that this construction is more permissive than
/// [`mem::transmute_copy`](super::transmute_copy); union-transmutes permit
/// conversions that extend the bits of `Src` with trailing padding to fill
/// trailing uninitialized bytes of `Self`; e.g.:
///
/// ```rust
/// #![feature(transmutability)]
///
/// use core::mem::{Assume, TransmuteFrom};
///
/// let src = 42u8; // size = 1
///
/// #[repr(C, align(2))]
/// struct Dst(u8); // size = 2
//
/// let _ = unsafe {
///     <Dst as TransmuteFrom<u8, { Assume::SAFETY }>>::transmute(src)
/// };
/// ```
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// ## Portability
///
/// Implementations of this trait do not provide any guarantee of portability
/// across toolchains, targets or compilations. This trait may be implemented
/// for certain combinations of `Src`, `Self` and `ASSUME` on some toolchains,
/// targets or compilations, but not others. For example, if the layouts of
/// `Src` or `Self` are non-deterministic, the presence or absence of an
/// implementation of this trait may also be non-deterministic. Even if `Src`
/// and `Self` have deterministic layouts (e.g., they are `repr(C)` structs),
/// Rust does not specify the alignments of its primitive integer types, and
/// layouts that involve these types may vary across toolchains, targets or
/// compilations.
///
/// ## Stability
///
/// Implementations of this trait do not provide any guarantee of SemVer
/// stability across the crate versions that define the `Src` and `Self` types.
/// If SemVer stability is crucial to your application, you must consult the
/// documentation of `Src` and `Self`s' defining crates. Note that the presence
/// of `repr(C)`, alone, does not carry a safety invariant of SemVer stability.
/// Furthermore, stability does not imply portability. For example, the size of
/// `usize` is stable, but not portable.
