/// A wrapper type to construct uninitialized instances of `T`.
///
/// # Initialization invariant
///
/// The compiler, in general, assumes that a variable is properly initialized
/// according to the requirements of the variable's type. For example, a variable of
/// reference type must be aligned and non-null. This is an invariant that must
/// *always* be upheld, even in unsafe code. As a consequence, zero-initializing a
/// variable of reference type causes instantaneous [undefined behavior][ub],
/// no matter whether that reference ever gets used to access memory:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![allow(invalid_value)]
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let x: &i32 = unsafe { mem::zeroed() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// // The equivalent code with `MaybeUninit<&i32>`:
/// let x: &i32 = unsafe { MaybeUninit::zeroed().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// ```
///
/// This is exploited by the compiler for various optimizations, such as eliding
/// run-time checks and optimizing `enum` layout.
///
/// Similarly, entirely uninitialized memory may have any content, while a `bool` must
/// always be `true` or `false`. Hence, creating an uninitialized `bool` is undefined behavior:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![allow(invalid_value)]
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let b: bool = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// // The equivalent code with `MaybeUninit<bool>`:
/// let b: bool = unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// ```
///
/// Moreover, uninitialized memory is special in that it does not have a fixed value ("fixed"
/// meaning "it won't change without being written to"). Reading the same uninitialized byte
/// multiple times can give different results. This makes it undefined behavior to have
/// uninitialized data in a variable even if that variable has an integer type, which otherwise can
/// hold any *fixed* bit pattern:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![allow(invalid_value)]
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let x: i32 = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// // The equivalent code with `MaybeUninit<i32>`:
/// let x: i32 = unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// ```
/// On top of that, remember that most types have additional invariants beyond merely
/// being considered initialized at the type level. For example, a `1`-initialized [`Vec<T>`]
/// is considered initialized (under the current implementation; this does not constitute
/// a stable guarantee) because the only requirement the compiler knows about it
/// is that the data pointer must be non-null. Creating such a `Vec<T>` does not cause
/// *immediate* undefined behavior, but will cause undefined behavior with most
/// safe operations (including dropping it).
///
/// [`Vec<T>`]: ../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// `MaybeUninit<T>` serves to enable unsafe code to deal with uninitialized data.
/// It is a signal to the compiler indicating that the data here might *not*
/// be initialized:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// // Create an explicitly uninitialized reference. The compiler knows that data inside
/// // a `MaybeUninit<T>` may be invalid, and hence this is not UB:
/// let mut x = MaybeUninit::<&i32>::uninit();
/// // Set it to a valid value.
/// x.write(&0);
/// // Extract the initialized data -- this is only allowed *after* properly
/// // initializing `x`!
/// let x = unsafe { x.assume_init() };
/// ```
///
/// The compiler then knows to not make any incorrect assumptions or optimizations on this code.
///
/// You can think of `MaybeUninit<T>` as being a bit like `Option<T>` but without
/// any of the run-time tracking and without any of the safety checks.
///
/// ## out-pointers
///
/// You can use `MaybeUninit<T>` to implement "out-pointers": instead of returning data
/// from a function, pass it a pointer to some (uninitialized) memory to put the
/// result into. This can be useful when it is important for the caller to control
/// how the memory the result is stored in gets allocated, and you want to avoid
/// unnecessary moves.
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// unsafe fn make_vec(out: *mut Vec<i32>) {
///     // `write` does not drop the old contents, which is important.
///     out.write(vec![1, 2, 3]);
/// }
///
/// let mut v = MaybeUninit::uninit();
/// unsafe { make_vec(v.as_mut_ptr()); }
/// // Now we know `v` is initialized! This also makes sure the vector gets
/// // properly dropped.
/// let v = unsafe { v.assume_init() };
/// assert_eq!(&v, &[1, 2, 3]);
/// ```
///
/// ## Initializing an array element-by-element
///
/// `MaybeUninit<T>` can be used to initialize a large array element-by-element:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let data = {
///     // Create an uninitialized array of `MaybeUninit`.
///     let mut data: [MaybeUninit<Vec<u32>>; 1000] = [const { MaybeUninit::uninit() }; 1000];
///
///     // Dropping a `MaybeUninit` does nothing, so if there is a panic during this loop,
///     // we have a memory leak, but there is no memory safety issue.
///     for elem in &mut data[..] {
///         elem.write(vec![42]);
///     }
///
///     // Everything is initialized. Transmute the array to the
///     // initialized type.
///     unsafe { mem::transmute::<_, [Vec<u32>; 1000]>(data) }
/// };
///
/// assert_eq!(&data[0], &[42]);
/// ```
///
/// You can also work with partially initialized arrays, which could
/// be found in low-level datastructures.
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// // Create an uninitialized array of `MaybeUninit`.
/// let mut data: [MaybeUninit<String>; 1000] = [const { MaybeUninit::uninit() }; 1000];
/// // Count the number of elements we have assigned.
/// let mut data_len: usize = 0;
///
/// for elem in &mut data[0..500] {
///     elem.write(String::from("hello"));
///     data_len += 1;
/// }
///
/// // For each item in the array, drop if we allocated it.
/// for elem in &mut data[0..data_len] {
///     unsafe { elem.assume_init_drop(); }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Initializing a struct field-by-field
///
/// You can use `MaybeUninit<T>`, and the [`std::ptr::addr_of_mut`] macro, to initialize structs field by field:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
/// use std::ptr::addr_of_mut;
///
/// #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
/// pub struct Foo {
///     name: String,
///     list: Vec<u8>,
/// }
///
/// let foo = {
///     let mut uninit: MaybeUninit<Foo> = MaybeUninit::uninit();
///     let ptr = uninit.as_mut_ptr();
///
///     // Initializing the `name` field
///     // Using `write` instead of assignment via `=` to not call `drop` on the
///     // old, uninitialized value.
///     unsafe { addr_of_mut!((*ptr).name).write("Bob".to_string()); }
///
///     // Initializing the `list` field
///     // If there is a panic here, then the `String` in the `name` field leaks.
///     unsafe { addr_of_mut!((*ptr).list).write(vec![0, 1, 2]); }
///
///     // All the fields are initialized, so we call `assume_init` to get an initialized Foo.
///     unsafe { uninit.assume_init() }
/// };
///
/// assert_eq!(
///     foo,
///     Foo {
///         name: "Bob".to_string(),
///         list: vec![0, 1, 2]
///     }
/// );
/// ```
/// [`std::ptr::addr_of_mut`]: crate::ptr::addr_of_mut
/// [ub]: ../../reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html
///
/// # Layout
///
/// `MaybeUninit<T>` is guaranteed to have the same size, alignment, and ABI as `T`:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::{MaybeUninit, size_of, align_of};
/// assert_eq!(size_of::<MaybeUninit<u64>>(), size_of::<u64>());
/// assert_eq!(align_of::<MaybeUninit<u64>>(), align_of::<u64>());
/// ```
///
/// However remember that a type *containing* a `MaybeUninit<T>` is not necessarily the same
/// layout; Rust does not in general guarantee that the fields of a `Foo<T>` have the same order as
/// a `Foo<U>` even if `T` and `U` have the same size and alignment. Furthermore because any bit
/// value is valid for a `MaybeUninit<T>` the compiler can't apply non-zero/niche-filling
/// optimizations, potentially resulting in a larger size:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::mem::{MaybeUninit, size_of};
/// assert_eq!(size_of::<Option<bool>>(), 1);
/// assert_eq!(size_of::<Option<MaybeUninit<bool>>>(), 2);
/// ```
///
/// If `T` is FFI-safe, then so is `MaybeUninit<T>`.
///
/// While `MaybeUninit` is `#[repr(transparent)]` (indicating it guarantees the same size,
/// alignment, and ABI as `T`), this does *not* change any of the previous caveats. `Option<T>` and
/// `Option<MaybeUninit<T>>` may still have different sizes, and types containing a field of type
/// `T` may be laid out (and sized) differently than if that field were `MaybeUninit<T>`.
/// `MaybeUninit` is a union type, and `#[repr(transparent)]` on unions is unstable (see [the
/// tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60405)). Over time, the exact
/// guarantees of `#[repr(transparent)]` on unions may evolve, and `MaybeUninit` may or may not
/// remain `#[repr(transparent)]`. That said, `MaybeUninit<T>` will *always* guarantee that it has
/// the same size, alignment, and ABI as `T`; it's just that the way `MaybeUninit` implements that
/// guarantee may evolve.
///
/// Note that even though `T` and `MaybeUninit<T>` are ABI compatible it is still unsound to
/// transmute `&mut T` to `&mut MaybeUninit<T>` and expose that to safe code because it would allow
/// safe code to access uninitialized memory:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// fn unsound_transmute<T>(val: &mut T) -> &mut MaybeUninit<T> {
///     unsafe { core::mem::transmute(val) }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let mut code = 0;
///     let code = &mut code;
///     let code2 = unsound_transmute(code);
///     *code2 = MaybeUninit::uninit();
///     std::process::exit(*code); // UB! Accessing uninitialized memory.
/// }
