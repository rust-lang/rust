//! The `Clone` trait for types that cannot be 'implicitly copied'.
//!
//! In Rust, some simple types are "implicitly copyable" and when you
//! assign them or pass them as arguments, the receiver will get a copy,
//! leaving the original value in place. These types do not require
//! allocation to copy and do not have finalizers (i.e., they do not
//! contain owned boxes or implement [`Drop`]), so the compiler considers
//! them cheap and safe to copy. For other types copies must be made
//! explicitly, by convention implementing the [`Clone`] trait and calling
//! the [`clone`] method.
//!
//! [`clone`]: Clone::clone
//!
//! Basic usage example:
//!
//! ```
//! let s = String::new(); // String type implements Clone
//! let copy = s.clone(); // so we can clone it
//! ```
//!
//! To easily implement the Clone trait, you can also use
//! `#[derive(Clone)]`. Example:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Clone)] // we add the Clone trait to Morpheus struct
//! struct Morpheus {
//!    blue_pill: f32,
//!    red_pill: i64,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    let f = Morpheus { blue_pill: 0.0, red_pill: 0 };
//!    let copy = f.clone(); // and now we can clone it!
//! }
//! ```

/// A common trait for the ability to explicitly duplicate an object.
///
/// Differs from [`Copy`] in that [`Copy`] is implicit and an inexpensive bit-wise copy, while
/// `Clone` is always explicit and may or may not be expensive. In order to enforce
/// these characteristics, Rust does not allow you to reimplement [`Copy`], but you
/// may reimplement `Clone` and run arbitrary code.
///
/// Since `Clone` is more general than [`Copy`], you can automatically make anything
/// [`Copy`] be `Clone` as well.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]` if all fields are `Clone`. The `derive`d
/// implementation of [`Clone`] calls [`clone`] on each field.
///
/// [`clone`]: Clone::clone
///
/// For a generic struct, `#[derive]` implements `Clone` conditionally by adding bound `Clone` on
/// generic parameters.
///
/// ```
/// // `derive` implements Clone for Reading<T> when T is Clone.
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct Reading<T> {
///     frequency: T,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I implement `Clone`?
///
/// Types that are [`Copy`] should have a trivial implementation of `Clone`. More formally:
/// if `T: Copy`, `x: T`, and `y: &T`, then `let x = y.clone();` is equivalent to `let x = *y;`.
/// Manual implementations should be careful to uphold this invariant; however, unsafe code
/// must not rely on it to ensure memory safety.
///
/// An example is a generic struct holding a function pointer. In this case, the
/// implementation of `Clone` cannot be `derive`d, but can be implemented as:
///
/// ```
/// struct Generate<T>(fn() -> T);
///
/// impl<T> Copy for Generate<T> {}
///
/// impl<T> Clone for Generate<T> {
///     fn clone(&self) -> Self {
///         *self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If we `derive`:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct Generate<T>(fn() -> T);
/// ```
///
/// the auto-derived implementations will have unnecessary `T: Copy` and `T: Clone` bounds:
///
/// ```
/// # struct Generate<T>(fn() -> T);
///
/// // Automatically derived
/// impl<T: Copy> Copy for Generate<T> { }
///
/// // Automatically derived
/// impl<T: Clone> Clone for Generate<T> {
///     fn clone(&self) -> Generate<T> {
///         Generate(Clone::clone(&self.0))
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The bounds are unnecessary because clearly the function itself should be
/// copy- and cloneable even if its return type is not:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0599
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct Generate<T>(fn() -> T);
///
/// struct NotCloneable;
///
/// fn generate_not_cloneable() -> NotCloneable {
///     NotCloneable
/// }
///
/// Generate(generate_not_cloneable).clone(); // error: trait bounds were not satisfied
/// // Note: With the manual implementations the above line will compile.
/// ```
///
/// ## Additional implementors
///
/// In addition to the [implementors listed below][impls],
/// the following types also implement `Clone`:
///
/// * Function item types (i.e., the distinct types defined for each function)
/// * Function pointer types (e.g., `fn() -> i32`)
/// * Closure types, if they capture no value from the environment
///   or if all such captured values implement `Clone` themselves.
///   Note that variables captured by shared reference always implement `Clone`
///   (even if the referent doesn't),
///   while variables captured by mutable reference never implement `Clone`.
