/// Compute w * 10^q using an extended-precision float representation.
///
/// Fast conversion of a the significant digits and decimal exponent
/// a float to an extended representation with a binary float. This
/// algorithm will accurately parse the vast majority of cases,
/// and uses a 128-bit representation (with a fallback 192-bit
/// representation).
///
/// This algorithm scales the exponent by the decimal exponent
/// using pre-computed powers-of-5, and calculates if the
/// representation can be unambiguously rounded to the nearest
/// machine float. Near-halfway cases are not handled here,
/// and are represented by a negative, biased binary exponent.
///
/// The algorithm is described in detail in "Daniel Lemire, Number Parsing
/// at a Gigabyte per Second" in section 5, "Fast Algorithm", and
/// section 6, "Exact Numbers And Ties", available online:
/// <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11408.pdf>.
