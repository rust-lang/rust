//! # The Rust Core Library
//!
//! The Rust Core Library is the dependency-free[^free] foundation of [The
//! Rust Standard Library](../std/index.html). It is the portable glue
//! between the language and its libraries, defining the intrinsic and
//! primitive building blocks of all Rust code. It links to no
//! upstream libraries, no system libraries, and no libc.
//!
//! [^free]: Strictly speaking, there are some symbols which are needed but
//!          they aren't always necessary.
//!
//! The core library is *minimal*: it isn't even aware of heap allocation,
//! nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require
//! platform integration, and this library is platform-agnostic.
//!
//! # How to use the core library
//!
//! Please note that all of these details are currently not considered stable.
//!
// FIXME: Fill me in with more detail when the interface settles
//! This library is built on the assumption of a few existing symbols:
//!
//! * `memcpy`, `memcmp`, `memset` - These are core memory routines which are
//!   often generated by LLVM. Additionally, this library can make explicit
//!   calls to these functions. Their signatures are the same as found in C.
//!   These functions are often provided by the system libc, but can also be
//!   provided by the [compiler-builtins crate](https://crates.io/crates/compiler_builtins).
//!
//! * `rust_begin_panic` - This function takes four arguments, a
//!   `fmt::Arguments`, a `&'static str`, and two `u32`'s. These four arguments
//!   dictate the panic message, the file at which panic was invoked, and the
//!   line and column inside the file. It is up to consumers of this core
//!   library to define this panic function; it is only required to never
//!   return. This requires a `lang` attribute named `panic_impl`.
//!
//! * `rust_eh_personality` - is used by the failure mechanisms of the
//!    compiler. This is often mapped to GCC's personality function, but crates
//!    which do not trigger a panic can be assured that this function is never
//!    called. The `lang` attribute is called `eh_personality`.

// Since libcore defines many fundamental lang items, all tests live in a
// separate crate, libcoretest, to avoid bizarre issues.
//
// Here we explicitly #[cfg]-out this whole crate when testing. If we don't do
// this, both the generated test artifact and the linked libtest (which
// transitively includes libcore) will both define the same set of lang items,
// and this will cause the E0152 "found duplicate lang item" error. See
// discussion in #50466 for details.
//
// This cfg won't affect doc tests.
