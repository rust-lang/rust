///
/// let x = Foo;
///
/// let y = x;
///
/// // `y` is a copy of `x`
///
/// println!("{x:?}"); // A-OK!

///
/// It's important to note that in these two examples, the only difference is whether you
/// are allowed to access `x` after the assignment. Under the hood, both a copy and a move
/// can result in bits being copied in memory, although this is sometimes optimized away.
///
/// ## How can I implement `Copy`?
///
/// There are two ways to implement `Copy` on your type. The simplest is to use `derive`:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct MyStruct;
/// ```
///
/// You can also implement `Copy` and `Clone` manually:
///
/// ```
/// struct MyStruct;
///
/// impl Copy for MyStruct { }
///
/// impl Clone for MyStruct {
///     fn clone(&self) -> MyStruct {
///         *self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There is a small difference between the two. The `derive` strategy will also place a `Copy`
/// bound on type parameters:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct MyStruct<T>(T);
///
/// impl<T: Copy> Copy for MyStruct<T> { }
/// ```
///
/// This isn't always desired. For example, shared references (`&T`) can be copied regardless of
/// whether `T` is `Copy`. Likewise, a generic struct containing markers such as [`PhantomData`]
/// could potentially be duplicated with a bit-wise copy.
///
/// ## What's the difference between `Copy` and `Clone`?
///
/// Copies happen implicitly, for example as part of an assignment `y = x`. The behavior of
/// `Copy` is not overloadable; it is always a simple bit-wise copy.
///
/// Cloning is an explicit action, `x.clone()`. The implementation of [`Clone`] can
/// provide any type-specific behavior necessary to duplicate values safely. For example,
/// the implementation of [`Clone`] for [`String`] needs to copy the pointed-to string
/// buffer in the heap. A simple bitwise copy of [`String`] values would merely copy the
/// pointer, leading to a double free down the line. For this reason, [`String`] is [`Clone`]
/// but not `Copy`.
///
/// [`Clone`] is a supertrait of `Copy`, so everything which is `Copy` must also implement
/// [`Clone`]. If a type is `Copy` then its [`Clone`] implementation only needs to return `*self`
/// (see the example above).
///
/// ## When can my type be `Copy`?
///
/// A type can implement `Copy` if all of its components implement `Copy`. For example, this
/// struct can be `Copy`:
///
/// ```
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct Point {
///    x: i32,
///    y: i32,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A struct can be `Copy`, and [`i32`] is `Copy`, therefore `Point` is eligible to be `Copy`.
/// By contrast, consider
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # struct Point;
/// struct PointList {
///     points: Vec<Point>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The struct `PointList` cannot implement `Copy`, because [`Vec<T>`] is not `Copy`. If we
/// attempt to derive a `Copy` implementation, we'll get an error:
///
/// ```text
/// the trait `Copy` cannot be implemented for this type; field `points` does not implement `Copy`
/// ```
///
/// Shared references (`&T`) are also `Copy`, so a type can be `Copy`, even when it holds
/// shared references of types `T` that are *not* `Copy`. Consider the following struct,
/// which can implement `Copy`, because it only holds a *shared reference* to our non-`Copy`
/// type `PointList` from above:
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # struct PointList;
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct PointListWrapper<'a> {
///     point_list_ref: &'a PointList,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## When *can't* my type be `Copy`?
///
/// Some types can't be copied safely. For example, copying `&mut T` would create an aliased
/// mutable reference. Copying [`String`] would duplicate responsibility for managing the
/// [`String`]'s buffer, leading to a double free.
///
/// Generalizing the latter case, any type implementing [`Drop`] can't be `Copy`, because it's
/// managing some resource besides its own [`size_of::<T>`] bytes.
///
/// If you try to implement `Copy` on a struct or enum containing non-`Copy` data, you will get
/// the error [E0204].
///
/// [E0204]: ../../error_codes/E0204.html
///
/// ## When *should* my type be `Copy`?
///
/// Generally speaking, if your type _can_ implement `Copy`, it should. Keep in mind, though,
/// that implementing `Copy` is part of the public API of your type. If the type might become
/// non-`Copy` in the future, it could be prudent to omit the `Copy` implementation now, to
/// avoid a breaking API change.
///
/// ## Additional implementors
///
/// In addition to the [implementors listed below][impls],
/// the following types also implement `Copy`:
///
/// * Function item types (i.e., the distinct types defined for each function)
/// * Function pointer types (e.g., `fn() -> i32`)
/// * Closure types, if they capture no value from the environment
///   or if all such captured values implement `Copy` themselves.
///   Note that variables captured by shared reference always implement `Copy`
///   (even if the referent doesn't),
///   while variables captured by mutable reference never implement `Copy`.

/// The precise definition is: a type `T` is [`Sync`] if and only if `&T` is
/// [`Send`]. In other words, if there is no possibility of
/// [undefined behavior][ub] (including data races) when passing
/// `&T` references between threads.
///
/// As one would expect, primitive types like [`u8`] and [`f64`]
/// are all [`Sync`], and so are simple aggregate types containing them,
/// like tuples, structs and enums. More examples of basic [`Sync`]
/// types include "immutable" types like `&T`, and those with simple
/// inherited mutability, such as [`Box<T>`][box], [`Vec<T>`][vec] and
/// most other collection types. (Generic parameters need to be [`Sync`]
/// for their container to be [`Sync`].)
///
/// A somewhat surprising consequence of the definition is that `&mut T`
/// is `Sync` (if `T` is `Sync`) even though it seems like that might
/// provide unsynchronized mutation. The trick is that a mutable
/// reference behind a shared reference (that is, `& &mut T`)
/// becomes read-only, as if it were a `& &T`. Hence there is no risk
/// of a data race.
///
/// A shorter overview of how [`Sync`] and [`Send`] relate to referencing:
/// * `&T` is [`Send`] if and only if `T` is [`Sync`]
/// * `&mut T` is [`Send`] if and only if `T` is [`Send`]
/// * `&T` and `&mut T` are [`Sync`] if and only if `T` is [`Sync`]
///
/// Types that are not `Sync` are those that have "interior
/// mutability" in a non-thread-safe form, such as [`Cell`][cell]
/// and [`RefCell`][refcell]. These types allow for mutation of
/// their contents even through an immutable, shared reference. For
/// example the `set` method on [`Cell<T>`][cell] takes `&self`, so it requires
/// only a shared reference [`&Cell<T>`][cell]. The method performs no
/// synchronization, thus [`Cell`][cell] cannot be `Sync`.
///
/// Another example of a non-`Sync` type is the reference-counting
/// pointer [`Rc`][rc]. Given any reference [`&Rc<T>`][rc], you can clone
/// a new [`Rc<T>`][rc], modifying the reference counts in a non-atomic way.
///
/// For cases when one does need thread-safe interior mutability,
/// Rust provides [atomic data types], as well as explicit locking via
/// [`sync::Mutex`][mutex] and [`sync::RwLock`][rwlock]. These types
/// ensure that any mutation cannot cause data races, hence the types
/// are `Sync`. Likewise, [`sync::Arc`][arc] provides a thread-safe
/// analogue of [`Rc`][rc].
///
/// Any types with interior mutability must also use the
/// [`cell::UnsafeCell`][unsafecell] wrapper around the value(s) which
/// can be mutated through a shared reference. Failing to doing this is
/// [undefined behavior][ub]. For example, [`transmute`][transmute]-ing
/// from `&T` to `&mut T` is invalid.

/// Zero-sized type used to mark things that "act like" they own a `T`.
///
/// Adding a `PhantomData<T>` field to your type tells the compiler that your
/// type acts as though it stores a value of type `T`, even though it doesn't
/// really. This information is used when computing certain safety properties.
///
/// For a more in-depth explanation of how to use `PhantomData<T>`, please see
/// [the Nomicon](../../nomicon/phantom-data.html).
///
/// # A ghastly note 👻👻👻
///
/// Though they both have scary names, `PhantomData` and 'phantom types' are
/// related, but not identical. A phantom type parameter is simply a type
/// parameter which is never used. In Rust, this often causes the compiler to
/// complain, and the solution is to add a "dummy" use by way of `PhantomData`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Unused lifetime parameters
///
/// Perhaps the most common use case for `PhantomData` is a struct that has an
/// unused lifetime parameter, typically as part of some unsafe code. For
/// example, here is a struct `Slice` that has two pointers of type `*const T`,
/// presumably pointing into an array somewhere:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0392
/// struct Slice<'a, T> {
///     start: *const T,
///     end: *const T,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The intention is that the underlying data is only valid for the
/// lifetime `'a`, so `Slice` should not outlive `'a`. However, this
/// intent is not expressed in the code, since there are no uses of
/// the lifetime `'a` and hence it is not clear what data it applies
/// to. We can correct this by telling the compiler to act *as if* the
/// `Slice` struct contained a reference `&'a T`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::marker::PhantomData;
///
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// struct Slice<'a, T> {
///     start: *const T,
///     end: *const T,
///     phantom: PhantomData<&'a T>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This also in turn infers the lifetime bound `T: 'a`, indicating
/// that any references in `T` are valid over the lifetime `'a`.
///
/// When initializing a `Slice` you simply provide the value
/// `PhantomData` for the field `phantom`:
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # use std::marker::PhantomData;
/// # struct Slice<'a, T> {
/// #     start: *const T,
/// #     end: *const T,
/// #     phantom: PhantomData<&'a T>,
/// # }
/// fn borrow_vec<T>(vec: &Vec<T>) -> Slice<'_, T> {
///     let ptr = vec.as_ptr();
///     Slice {
///         start: ptr,
///         end: unsafe { ptr.add(vec.len()) },
///         phantom: PhantomData,
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Unused type parameters
///
/// It sometimes happens that you have unused type parameters which
/// indicate what type of data a struct is "tied" to, even though that
/// data is not actually found in the struct itself. Here is an
/// example where this arises with [FFI]. The foreign interface uses
/// handles of type `*mut ()` to refer to Rust values of different
/// types. We track the Rust type using a phantom type parameter on
/// the struct `ExternalResource` which wraps a handle.
///
/// [FFI]: ../../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # trait ResType { }
/// # struct ParamType;
/// # mod foreign_lib {
/// #     pub fn new(_: usize) -> *mut () { 42 as *mut () }
/// #     pub fn do_stuff(_: *mut (), _: usize) {}
/// # }
/// # fn convert_params(_: ParamType) -> usize { 42 }
/// use std::marker::PhantomData;
/// use std::mem;
///
/// struct ExternalResource<R> {
///    resource_handle: *mut (),
///    resource_type: PhantomData<R>,
/// }
///
/// impl<R: ResType> ExternalResource<R> {
///     fn new() -> Self {
///         let size_of_res = mem::size_of::<R>();
///         Self {
///             resource_handle: foreign_lib::new(size_of_res),
///             resource_type: PhantomData,
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn do_stuff(&self, param: ParamType) {
///         let foreign_params = convert_params(param);
///         foreign_lib::do_stuff(self.resource_handle, foreign_params);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Ownership and the drop check
///
/// The exact interaction of `PhantomData` with drop check **may change in the future**.
///
/// Currently, adding a field of type `PhantomData<T>` indicates that your type *owns* data of type
/// `T` in very rare circumstances. This in turn has effects on the Rust compiler's [drop check]
/// analysis. For the exact rules, see the [drop check] documentation.
///
/// ## Layout
///
/// For all `T`, the following are guaranteed:
/// * `size_of::<PhantomData<T>>() == 0`
/// * `align_of::<PhantomData<T>>() == 1`
///

/// Types that do not require any pinning guarantees.

/// For information on what "pinning" is, see the [`pin` module] documentation.
///
/// Implementing the `Unpin` trait for `T` expresses the fact that `T` is pinning-agnostic:
/// it shall not expose nor rely on any pinning guarantees. This, in turn, means that a
/// `Pin`-wrapped pointer to such a type can feature a *fully unrestricted* API.
/// In other words, if `T: Unpin`, a value of type `T` will *not* be bound by the invariants
/// which pinning otherwise offers, even when "pinned" by a [`Pin<Ptr>`] pointing at it.
/// When a value of type `T` is pointed at by a [`Pin<Ptr>`], [`Pin`] will not restrict access
/// to the pointee value like it normally would, thus allowing the user to do anything that they
/// normally could with a non-[`Pin`]-wrapped `Ptr` to that value.
///
/// The idea of this trait is to alleviate the reduced ergonomics of APIs that require the use
/// of [`Pin`] for soundness for some types, but which also want to be used by other types that
/// don't care about pinning. The prime example of such an API is [`Future::poll`]. There are many
/// [`Future`] types that don't care about pinning. These futures can implement `Unpin` and
/// therefore get around the pinning related restrictions in the API, while still allowing the
/// subset of [`Future`]s which *do* require pinning to be implemented soundly.
///
/// For more discussion on the consequences of [`Unpin`] within the wider scope of the pinning
/// system, see the [section about `Unpin`] in the [`pin` module].
///
/// `Unpin` has no consequence at all for non-pinned data. In particular, [`mem::replace`] happily
/// moves `!Unpin` data, which would be immovable when pinned ([`mem::replace`] works for any
/// `&mut T`, not just when `T: Unpin`).
///
/// *However*, you cannot use [`mem::replace`] on `!Unpin` data which is *pinned* by being wrapped
/// inside a [`Pin<Ptr>`] pointing at it. This is because you cannot (safely) use a
/// [`Pin<Ptr>`] to get a `&mut T` to its pointee value, which you would need to call
/// [`mem::replace`], and *that* is what makes this system work.
///
/// So this, for example, can only be done on types implementing `Unpin`:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::pin::Pin;
///
/// let mut string = "this".to_string();
/// let mut pinned_string = Pin::new(&mut string);
///
/// // We need a mutable reference to call `mem::replace`.
/// // We can obtain such a reference by (implicitly) invoking `Pin::deref_mut`,
/// // but that is only possible because `String` implements `Unpin`.
/// mem::replace(&mut *pinned_string, "other".to_string());
/// ```
///
/// This trait is automatically implemented for almost every type. The compiler is free
/// to take the conservative stance of marking types as [`Unpin`] so long as all of the types that
/// compose its fields are also [`Unpin`]. This is because if a type implements [`Unpin`], then it
/// is unsound for that type's implementation to rely on pinning-related guarantees for soundness,
/// *even* when viewed through a "pinning" pointer! It is the responsibility of the implementor of
/// a type that relies upon pinning for soundness to ensure that type is *not* marked as [`Unpin`]
/// by adding [`PhantomPinned`] field. For more details, see the [`pin` module] docs.
