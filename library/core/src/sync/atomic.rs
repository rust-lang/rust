//! Atomic types
//!
//! Atomic types provide primitive shared-memory communication between
//! threads, and are the building blocks of other concurrent
//! types.
//!
//! This module defines atomic versions of a select number of primitive
//! types, including [`AtomicBool`], [`AtomicIsize`], [`AtomicUsize`],
//! [`AtomicI8`], [`AtomicU16`], etc.
//! Atomic types present operations that, when used correctly, synchronize
//! updates between threads.
//!
//! Atomic variables are safe to share between threads (they implement [`Sync`])
//! but they do not themselves provide the mechanism for sharing and follow the
//! [threading model](../../../std/thread/index.html#the-threading-model) of Rust.
//! The most common way to share an atomic variable is to put it into an [`Arc`][arc] (an
//! atomically-reference-counted shared pointer).
//!
//! [arc]: ../../../std/sync/struct.Arc.html
//!
//! Atomic types may be stored in static variables, initialized using
//! the constant initializers like [`AtomicBool::new`]. Atomic statics
//! are often used for lazy global initialization.
//!
//! ## Memory model for atomic accesses
//!
//! Rust atomics currently follow the same rules as [C++20 atomics][cpp], specifically the rules
//! from the [`intro.races`][cpp-intro.races] section, without the "consume" memory ordering. Since
//! C++ uses an object-based memory model whereas Rust is access-based, a bit of translation work
//! has to be done to apply the C++ rules to Rust: whenever C++ talks about "the value of an
//! object", we understand that to mean the resulting bytes obtained when doing a read. When the C++
//! standard talks about "the value of an atomic object", this refers to the result of doing an
//! atomic load (via the operations provided in this module). A "modification of an atomic object"
//! refers to an atomic store.
//!
//! The end result is *almost* equivalent to saying that creating a *shared reference* to one of the
//! Rust atomic types corresponds to creating an `atomic_ref` in C++, with the `atomic_ref` being
//! destroyed when the lifetime of the shared reference ends. The main difference is that Rust
//! permits concurrent atomic and non-atomic reads to the same memory as those cause no issue in the
//! C++ memory model, they are just forbidden in C++ because memory is partitioned into "atomic
//! objects" and "non-atomic objects" (with `atomic_ref` temporarily converting a non-atomic object
//! into an atomic object).
//!
//! The most important aspect of this model is that *data races* are undefined behavior. A data race
//! is defined as conflicting non-synchronized accesses where at least one of the accesses is
//! non-atomic. Here, accesses are *conflicting* if they affect overlapping regions of memory and at
//! least one of them is a write. They are *non-synchronized* if neither of them *happens-before*
//! the other, according to the happens-before order of the memory model.
//!
//! The other possible cause of undefined behavior in the memory model are mixed-size accesses: Rust
//! inherits the C++ limitation that non-synchronized conflicting atomic accesses may not partially
//! overlap. In other words, every pair of non-synchronized atomic accesses must be either disjoint,
//! access the exact same memory (including using the same access size), or both be reads.
//!
//! Each atomic access takes an [`Ordering`] which defines how the operation interacts with the
//! happens-before order. These orderings behave the same as the corresponding [C++20 atomic
//! orderings][cpp_memory_order]. For more information, see the [nomicon].

//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! All atomic types in this module are guaranteed to be [lock-free] if they're
//! available. This means they don't internally acquire a global mutex. Atomic
//! types and operations are not guaranteed to be wait-free. This means that
//! operations like `fetch_or` may be implemented with a compare-and-swap loop.
//!
//! Atomic operations may be implemented at the instruction layer with
//! larger-size atomics. For example some platforms use 4-byte atomic
//! instructions to implement `AtomicI8`. Note that this emulation should not
//! have an impact on correctness of code, it's just something to be aware of.
//!
//! The atomic types in this module might not be available on all platforms. The
//! atomic types here are all widely available, however, and can generally be
//! relied upon existing. Some notable exceptions are:
//!
//! * PowerPC and MIPS platforms with 32-bit pointers do not have `AtomicU64` or
//!   `AtomicI64` types.
//! * ARM platforms like `armv5te` that aren't for Linux only provide `load`
//!   and `store` operations, and do not support Compare and Swap (CAS)
//!   operations, such as `swap`, `fetch_add`, etc. Additionally on Linux,
//!   these CAS operations are implemented via [operating system support], which
//!   may come with a performance penalty.
//! * ARM targets with `thumbv6m` only provide `load` and `store` operations,
//!   and do not support Compare and Swap (CAS) operations, such as `swap`,
//!   `fetch_add`, etc.
//!
//! [operating system support]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt
//!
//! Note that future platforms may be added that also do not have support for
//! some atomic operations. Maximally portable code will want to be careful
//! about which atomic types are used. `AtomicUsize` and `AtomicIsize` are
//! generally the most portable, but even then they're not available everywhere.
//! For reference, the `std` library requires `AtomicBool`s and pointer-sized atomics, although
//! `core` does not.
//!
//! The `#[cfg(target_has_atomic)]` attribute can be used to conditionally
//! compile based on the target's supported bit widths. It is a key-value
//! option set for each supported size, with values "8", "16", "32", "64",
//! "128", and "ptr" for pointer-sized atomics.
//!
//! [lock-free]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm
//!
//! # Atomic accesses to read-only memory
//!
//! In general, *all* atomic accesses on read-only memory are undefined behavior. For instance, attempting
//! to do a `compare_exchange` that will definitely fail (making it conceptually a read-only
//! operation) can still cause a segmentation fault if the underlying memory page is mapped read-only. Since
//! atomic `load`s might be implemented using compare-exchange operations, even a `load` can fault
//! on read-only memory.
//!
//! For the purpose of this section, "read-only memory" is defined as memory that is read-only in
//! the underlying target, i.e., the pages are mapped with a read-only flag and any attempt to write
//! will cause a page fault. In particular, an `&u128` reference that points to memory that is
//! read-write mapped is *not* considered to point to "read-only memory". In Rust, almost all memory
//! is read-write; the only exceptions are memory created by `const` items or `static` items without
//! interior mutability, and memory that was specifically marked as read-only by the operating
//! system via platform-specific APIs.
//!
//! As an exception from the general rule stated above, "sufficiently small" atomic loads with
//! `Ordering::Relaxed` are implemented in a way that works on read-only memory, and are hence not
//! undefined behavior. The exact size limit for what makes a load "sufficiently small" varies
//! depending on the target:
//!
//! | `target_arch` | Size limit |
//! |---------------|---------|
//! | `x86`, `arm`, `mips`, `mips32r6`, `powerpc`, `riscv32`, `sparc`, `hexagon` | 4 bytes |
//! | `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `loongarch64`, `mips64`, `mips64r6`, `powerpc64`, `riscv64`, `sparc64`, `s390x` | 8 bytes |
//!
//! Atomics loads that are larger than this limit as well as atomic loads with ordering other
//! than `Relaxed`, as well as *all* atomic loads on targets not listed in the table, might still be
//! read-only under certain conditions, but that is not a stable guarantee and should not be relied
//! upon.
//!
//! If you need to do an acquire load on read-only memory, you can do a relaxed load followed by an
//! acquire fence instead.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A simple spinlock:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
//! use std::{hint, thread};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let spinlock = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(1));
//!
//!     let spinlock_clone = Arc::clone(&spinlock);
//!
//!     let thread = thread::spawn(move || {
//!         spinlock_clone.store(0, Ordering::Release);
//!     });
//!
//!     // Wait for the other thread to release the lock
//!     while spinlock.load(Ordering::Acquire) != 0 {
//!         hint::spin_loop();
//!     }
//!
//!     if let Err(panic) = thread.join() {
//!         println!("Thread had an error: {panic:?}");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Keep a global count of live threads:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
//!
//! static GLOBAL_THREAD_COUNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
//!
//! // Note that Relaxed ordering doesn't synchronize anything
//! // except the global thread counter itself.
//! let old_thread_count = GLOBAL_THREAD_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
//! // Note that this number may not be true at the moment of printing
//! // because some other thread may have changed static value already.
//! println!("live threads: {}", old_thread_count + 1);
//! ```

///
/// Like [`fence`], this function establishes synchronization with other atomic operations and
/// fences. However, unlike [`fence`], `compiler_fence` only establishes synchronization with
/// operations *in the same thread*. This may at first sound rather useless, since code within a
/// thread is typically already totally ordered and does not need any further synchronization.
/// However, there are cases where code can run on the same thread without being ordered:
/// - The most common case is that of a *signal handler*: a signal handler runs in the same thread
///   as the code it interrupted, but it is not ordered with respect to that code. `compiler_fence`
///   can be used to establish synchronization between a thread and its signal handler, the same way
///   that `fence` can be used to establish synchronization across threads.
/// - Similar situations can arise in embedded programming with interrupt handlers, or in custom
///   implementations of preemptive green threads. In general, `compiler_fence` can establish
///   synchronization with code that is guaranteed to run on the same hardware CPU.
///
/// See [`fence`] for how a fence can be used to achieve synchronization. Note that just like
/// [`fence`], synchronization still requires atomic operations to be used in both threads -- it is
/// not possible to perform synchronization entirely with fences and non-atomic operations.
///
/// `compiler_fence` does not emit any machine code, but restricts the kinds of memory re-ordering
/// the compiler is allowed to do. `compiler_fence` corresponds to [`atomic_signal_fence`] in C and
/// C++.
///
/// [`atomic_signal_fence`]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic_signal_fence
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if `order` is [`Relaxed`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Without `compiler_fence`, the `assert_eq!` in following code
/// is *not* guaranteed to succeed, despite everything happening in a single thread.
/// To see why, remember that the compiler is free to swap the stores to
/// `IMPORTANT_VARIABLE` and `IS_READY` since they are both
/// `Ordering::Relaxed`. If it does, and the signal handler is invoked right
/// after `IS_READY` is updated, then the signal handler will see
/// `IS_READY=1`, but `IMPORTANT_VARIABLE=0`.
/// Using a `compiler_fence` remedies this situation.
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicUsize};
/// use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
