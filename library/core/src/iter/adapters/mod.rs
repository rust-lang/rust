/// This trait provides transitive access to source-stage in an iterator-adapter pipeline
/// under the conditions that
/// * the iterator source `S` itself implements `SourceIter<Source = S>`
/// * there is a delegating implementation of this trait for each adapter in the pipeline between
///   the source and the pipeline consumer.
///
/// When the source is an owning iterator struct (commonly called `IntoIter`) then
/// this can be useful for specializing [`FromIterator`] implementations or recovering the
/// remaining elements after an iterator has been partially exhausted.
///
/// Note that implementations do not necessarily have to provide access to the innermost
/// source of a pipeline. A stateful intermediate adapter might eagerly evaluate a part
/// of the pipeline and expose its internal storage as source.
///
/// The trait is unsafe because implementers must uphold additional safety properties.
/// See [`as_inner`] for details.
///
/// The primary use of this trait is in-place iteration. Refer to the [`vec::in_place_collect`]
/// module documentation for more information.
///
/// [`vec::in_place_collect`]: ../../../../alloc/vec/in_place_collect/index.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Retrieving a partially consumed source:
///
/// ```
/// # #![feature(inplace_iteration)]
/// # use std::iter::SourceIter;
///
/// let mut iter = vec![9, 9, 9].into_iter().map(|i| i * i);
/// let _ = iter.next();
/// let mut remainder = std::mem::replace(unsafe { iter.as_inner() }, Vec::new().into_iter());
/// println!("n = {} elements remaining", remainder.len());
/// ```

    ///
    /// Implementations must return the same mutable reference for their lifetime, unless
    /// replaced by a caller.
    ///
    /// Callers may only replace the reference when they stopped iteration and drop the
    /// iterator pipeline after extracting the source.
    ///
    /// This means iterator adapters can rely on the source not changing during
    /// iteration but they cannot rely on it in their Drop implementations.
    ///
    /// Implementing this method means adapters relinquish private-only access to their
    /// source and can only rely on guarantees made based on method receiver types.
    /// The lack of restricted access also requires that adapters must uphold the source's
    /// public API even when they have access to its internals.
    ///
    /// Callers in turn must expect the source to be in any state that is consistent with
    /// its public API since adapters sitting between it and the source have the same
    /// access. In particular an adapter may have consumed more elements than strictly necessary.
    ///
    /// The overall goal of these requirements is to let the consumer of a pipeline use

    /// * the memory that has become unused by advancing a consuming iterator
