use crate::iter::{FusedIterator, TrustedLen};

/// Creates an iterator that yields an element exactly once.
///
/// This is commonly used to adapt a single value into a [`chain()`] of other
/// kinds of iteration. Maybe you have an iterator that covers almost
/// everything, but you need an extra special case. Maybe you have a function
/// which works on iterators, but you only need to process one value.
///
/// [`chain()`]: Iterator::chain
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// use std::iter;
///
/// // one is the loneliest number
/// let mut one = iter::once(1);
///
/// assert_eq!(Some(1), one.next());
///
/// // just one, that's all we get
/// assert_eq!(None, one.next());
/// ```
///
/// Chaining together with another iterator. Let's say that we want to iterate
/// over each file of the `.foo` directory, but also a configuration file,
/// `.foorc`:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::iter;
/// use std::fs;
/// use std::path::PathBuf;
///
/// let dirs = fs::read_dir(".foo").unwrap();
///
/// // we need to convert from an iterator of DirEntry-s to an iterator of
/// // PathBufs, so we use map
/// let dirs = dirs.map(|file| file.unwrap().path());
///
/// // now, our iterator just for our config file
/// let config = iter::once(PathBuf::from(".foorc"));
///
/// // chain the two iterators together into one big iterator
/// let files = dirs.chain(config);
///
/// // this will give us all of the files in .foo as well as .foorc
/// for f in files {
///     println!("{f:?}");
/// }
/// ```
