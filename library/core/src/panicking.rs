//! Panic support for core
//!
//! In core, panicking is always done with a message, resulting in a `core::panic::PanicInfo`
//! containing a `fmt::Arguments`. In std, however, panicking can be done with panic_any, which
//! throws a `Box<dyn Any>` containing any type of value. Because of this,
//! `std::panic::PanicHookInfo` is a different type, which contains a `&dyn Any` instead of a
//! `fmt::Arguments`. std's panic handler will convert the `fmt::Arguments` to a `&dyn Any`
//! containing either a `&'static str` or `String` containing the formatted message.
//!
//! The core library cannot define any panic handler, but it can invoke it.
//! This means that the functions inside of core are allowed to panic, but to be
//! useful an upstream crate must define panicking for core to use. The current
//! interface for panicking is:
//!
//! ```
//! fn panic_impl(pi: &core::panic::PanicInfo<'_>) -> !
//! # { loop {} }
//! ```
//!
//! This module contains a few other panicking functions, but these are just the
//! necessary lang items for the compiler. All panics are funneled through this
//! one function. The actual symbol is declared through the `#[panic_handler]` attribute.
