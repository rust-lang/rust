/// A memory allocator that can be registered as the standard libraryâ€™s default
/// through the `#[global_allocator]` attribute.

/// Some of the methods require that a memory block be *currently
/// allocated* via an allocator. This means that:
///
/// * the starting address for that memory block was previously
///   returned by a previous call to an allocation method
///   such as `alloc`, and
///
/// * the memory block has not been subsequently deallocated, where
///   blocks are deallocated either by being passed to a deallocation
///   method such as `dealloc` or by being
///   passed to a reallocation method that returns a non-null pointer.

/// # Safety
///
/// The `GlobalAlloc` trait is an `unsafe` trait for a number of reasons, and
/// implementors must ensure that they adhere to these contracts:
///
/// * It's undefined behavior if global allocators unwind. This restriction may
///   be lifted in the future, but currently a panic from any of these
///   functions may lead to memory unsafety.
///
/// * `Layout` queries and calculations in general must be correct. Callers of
///   this trait are allowed to rely on the contracts defined on each method,
///   and implementors must ensure such contracts remain true.
///
/// * You must not rely on allocations actually happening, even if there are explicit
///   heap allocations in the source. The optimizer may detect unused allocations that it can either
///   eliminate entirely or move to the stack and thus never invoke the allocator. The
///   optimizer may further assume that allocation is infallible, so code that used to fail due
///   to allocator failures may now suddenly work because the optimizer worked around the
///   need for an allocation. More concretely, the following code example is unsound, irrespective
///   of whether your custom allocator allows counting how many allocations have happened.
///
///   ```rust,ignore (unsound and has placeholders)
///   drop(Box::new(42));
///   let number_of_heap_allocs = /* call private allocator API */;
///   unsafe { std::hint::assert_unchecked(number_of_heap_allocs > 0); }
///   ```
///
///   Note that the optimizations mentioned above are not the only
///   optimization that can be applied. You may generally not rely on heap allocations
///   happening if they can be removed without changing program behavior.
///   Whether allocations happen or not is not part of the program behavior, even if it
///   could be detected via an allocator that tracks allocations by printing or otherwise
///   having side effects.
