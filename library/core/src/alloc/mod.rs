/// An implementation of `Allocator` can allocate, grow, shrink, and deallocate arbitrary blocks of
/// data described via [`Layout`][].
///
/// `Allocator` is designed to be implemented on ZSTs, references, or smart pointers because having
/// an allocator like `MyAlloc([u8; N])` cannot be moved, without updating the pointers to the
/// allocated memory.
///
/// Unlike [`GlobalAlloc`][], zero-sized allocations are allowed in `Allocator`. If an underlying
/// allocator does not support this (like jemalloc) or return a null pointer (such as
/// `libc::malloc`), this must be caught by the implementation.
///
/// ### Currently allocated memory
///
/// Some of the methods require that a memory block be *currently allocated* via an allocator. This
/// means that:
///
/// * the starting address for that memory block was previously returned by [`allocate`], [`grow`], or
///   [`shrink`], and
///
/// * the memory block has not been subsequently deallocated, where blocks are either deallocated
///   directly by being passed to [`deallocate`] or were changed by being passed to [`grow`] or
///   [`shrink`] that returns `Ok`. If `grow` or `shrink` have returned `Err`, the passed pointer
///   remains valid.
///
/// [`allocate`]: Allocator::allocate
/// [`grow`]: Allocator::grow
/// [`shrink`]: Allocator::shrink
/// [`deallocate`]: Allocator::deallocate
///
/// ### Memory fitting
///
/// Some of the methods require that a layout *fit* a memory block. What it means for a layout to
/// "fit" a memory block means (or equivalently, for a memory block to "fit" a layout) is that the
/// following conditions must hold:
///
/// * The block must be allocated with the same alignment as [`layout.align()`], and
///
/// * The provided [`layout.size()`] must fall in the range `min ..= max`, where:
///   - `min` is the size of the layout most recently used to allocate the block, and
///   - `max` is the latest actual size returned from [`allocate`], [`grow`], or [`shrink`].
///
/// [`layout.align()`]: Layout::align
/// [`layout.size()`]: Layout::size
///
/// # Safety
///
/// * Memory blocks returned from an allocator that are [*currently allocated*] must point to
///   valid memory and retain their validity while they are [*currently allocated*] and the shorter
///   of:
///   - the borrow-checker lifetime of the allocator type itself.
///   - as long as at least one of the instance and all of its clones has not been dropped.
///
/// * copying, cloning, or moving the allocator must not invalidate memory blocks returned from this
///   allocator. A copied or cloned allocator must behave like the same allocator, and
///
/// * any pointer to a memory block which is [*currently allocated*] may be passed to any other
///   method of the allocator.
