/// The boolean type.
///
/// The `bool` represents a value, which could only be either [`true`] or [`false`]. If you cast
/// a `bool` into an integer, [`true`] will be 1 and [`false`] will be 0.
///
/// # Basic usage
///
/// `bool` implements various traits, such as [`BitAnd`], [`BitOr`], [`Not`], etc.,
/// which allow us to perform boolean operations using `&`, `|` and `!`.
///
/// [`if`] requires a `bool` value as its conditional. [`assert!`], which is an
/// important macro in testing, checks whether an expression is [`true`] and panics
/// if it isn't.
///
/// ```
/// let bool_val = true & false | false;
/// assert!(!bool_val);
/// ```
///
/// [`true`]: ../std/keyword.true.html
/// [`false`]: ../std/keyword.false.html
/// [`BitAnd`]: ops::BitAnd
/// [`BitOr`]: ops::BitOr
/// [`Not`]: ops::Not
/// [`if`]: ../std/keyword.if.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A trivial example of the usage of `bool`:
///
/// ```
/// let praise_the_borrow_checker = true;
///
/// // using the `if` conditional
/// if praise_the_borrow_checker {
///     println!("oh, yeah!");
/// } else {
///     println!("what?!!");
/// }
///
/// // ... or, a match pattern
/// match praise_the_borrow_checker {
///     true => println!("keep praising!"),
///     false => println!("you should praise!"),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Also, since `bool` implements the [`Copy`] trait, we don't
/// have to worry about the move semantics (just like the integer and float primitives).
///
/// Now an example of `bool` cast to integer type:
///
/// ```
/// assert_eq!(true as i32, 1);
/// assert_eq!(false as i32, 0);

#[rustc_doc_primitive = "never"]
#[doc(alias = "!")]
//
/// The `!` type, also called "never".
///
/// `!` represents the type of computations which never resolve to any value at all. For example,
/// the [`exit`] function `fn exit(code: i32) -> !` exits the process without ever returning, and
/// so returns `!`.
///
/// `break`, `continue` and `return` expressions also have type `!`. For example we are allowed to
/// write:
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(never_type)]
/// # fn foo() -> u32 {
/// let x: ! = {
///     return 123
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Although the `let` is pointless here, it illustrates the meaning of `!`. Since `x` is never
/// assigned a value (because `return` returns from the entire function), `x` can be given type
/// `!`. We could also replace `return 123` with a `panic!` or a never-ending `loop` and this code
/// would still be valid.
///
/// A more realistic usage of `!` is in this code:
///
/// ```
/// # fn get_a_number() -> Option<u32> { None }
/// # loop {
/// let num: u32 = match get_a_number() {
///     Some(num) => num,
///     None => break,
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Both match arms must produce values of type [`u32`], but since `break` never produces a value
/// at all we know it can never produce a value which isn't a [`u32`]. This illustrates another
/// behavior of the `!` type - expressions with type `!` will coerce into any other type.
///
/// [`u32`]: prim@u32
/// [`exit`]: ../std/process/fn.exit.html
///
/// # `!` and generics
///
/// ## Infallible errors
///
/// The main place you'll see `!` used explicitly is in generic code. Consider the [`FromStr`]
/// trait:
///
/// ```
/// trait FromStr: Sized {
///     type Err;
///     fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err>;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When implementing this trait for [`String`] we need to pick a type for [`Err`]. And since
/// converting a string into a string will never result in an error, the appropriate type is `!`.
/// (Currently the type actually used is an enum with no variants, though this is only because `!`
/// was added to Rust at a later date and it may change in the future.) With an [`Err`] type of
/// `!`, if we have to call [`String::from_str`] for some reason the result will be a
/// [`Result<String, !>`] which we can unpack like this:
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(exhaustive_patterns)]
/// use std::str::FromStr;
/// let Ok(s) = String::from_str("hello");
/// ```
///
/// Since the [`Err`] variant contains a `!`, it can never occur. If the `exhaustive_patterns`
/// feature is present this means we can exhaustively match on [`Result<T, !>`] by just taking the
/// [`Ok`] variant. This illustrates another behavior of `!` - it can be used to "delete" certain
/// enum variants from generic types like `Result`.
///
/// ## Infinite loops
///
/// While [`Result<T, !>`] is very useful for removing errors, `!` can also be used to remove
/// successes as well. If we think of [`Result<T, !>`] as "if this function returns, it has not
/// errored," we get a very intuitive idea of [`Result<!, E>`] as well: if the function returns, it
/// *has* errored.
///
/// For example, consider the case of a simple web server, which can be simplified to:
///
/// ```ignore (hypothetical-example)
/// loop {
///     let (client, request) = get_request().expect("disconnected");
///     let response = request.process();
///     response.send(client);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Currently, this isn't ideal, because we simply panic whenever we fail to get a new connection.
/// Instead, we'd like to keep track of this error, like this:
///
/// ```ignore (hypothetical-example)
/// loop {
///     match get_request() {
///         Err(err) => break err,
///         Ok((client, request)) => {
///             let response = request.process();
///             response.send(client);
///         },
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, when the server disconnects, we exit the loop with an error instead of panicking. While it
/// might be intuitive to simply return the error, we might want to wrap it in a [`Result<!, E>`]
/// instead:
///
/// ```ignore (hypothetical-example)
/// fn server_loop() -> Result<!, ConnectionError> {
///     loop {
///         let (client, request) = get_request()?;
///         let response = request.process();
///         response.send(client);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, we can use `?` instead of `match`, and the return type makes a lot more sense: if the loop
/// ever stops, it means that an error occurred. We don't even have to wrap the loop in an `Ok`
/// because `!` coerces to `Result<!, ConnectionError>` automatically.
///
/// [`String::from_str`]: str::FromStr::from_str
/// [`String`]: ../std/string/struct.String.html
/// [`FromStr`]: str::FromStr
///
/// # `!` and traits
///
/// When writing your own traits, `!` should have an `impl` whenever there is an obvious `impl`
/// which doesn't `panic!`. The reason is that functions returning an `impl Trait` where `!`
/// does not have an `impl` of `Trait` cannot diverge as their only possible code path. In other
/// words, they can't return `!` from every code path. As an example, this code doesn't compile:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use std::ops::Add;
///
/// fn foo() -> impl Add<u32> {
///     unimplemented!()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// But this code does:
///
/// ```
/// use std::ops::Add;
///
/// fn foo() -> impl Add<u32> {
///     if true {
///         unimplemented!()
///     } else {
///         0
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The reason is that, in the first example, there are many possible types that `!` could coerce
/// to, because many types implement `Add<u32>`. However, in the second example,
/// the `else` branch returns a `0`, which the compiler infers from the return type to be of type
/// `u32`. Since `u32` is a concrete type, `!` can and will be coerced to it. See issue [#36375]
/// for more information on this quirk of `!`.
///
/// [#36375]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/36375
///
/// As it turns out, though, most traits can have an `impl` for `!`. Take [`Debug`]
/// for example:
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(never_type)]
/// # use std::fmt;
/// # trait Debug {
/// #     fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result;
/// # }
/// impl Debug for ! {
///     fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
///         *self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Once again we're using `!`'s ability to coerce into any other type, in this case
/// [`fmt::Result`]. Since this method takes a `&!` as an argument we know that it can never be
/// called (because there is no value of type `!` for it to be called with). Writing `*self`
/// essentially tells the compiler "We know that this code can never be run, so just treat the
/// entire function body as having type [`fmt::Result`]". This pattern can be used a lot when
/// implementing traits for `!`. Generally, any trait which only has methods which take a `self`
/// parameter should have such an impl.
///
/// On the other hand, one trait which would not be appropriate to implement is [`Default`]:
///
/// ```
/// trait Default {
///     fn default() -> Self;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since `!` has no values, it has no default value either. It's true that we could write an
/// `impl` for this which simply panics, but the same is true for any type (we could `impl
/// Default` for (eg.) [`File`] by just making [`default()`] panic.)
///
/// [`File`]: ../std/fs/struct.File.html
/// [`Debug`]: fmt::Debug
/// [`default()`]: Default::default
///
/// # Never type fallback
///
/// When the compiler sees a value of type `!` in a [coercion site], it implicitly inserts a
/// coercion to allow the type checker to infer any type:
///
/// ```rust,ignore (illustrative-and-has-placeholders)
/// // this
/// let x: u8 = panic!();
///
/// // is (essentially) turned by the compiler into
/// let x: u8 = absurd(panic!());
///
/// // where absurd is a function with the following signature
/// // (it's sound, because `!` always marks unreachable code):
/// fn absurd<T>(_: !) -> T { ... }
// FIXME: use `core::convert::absurd` here instead, once it's merged
/// ```
///
/// This can lead to compilation errors if the type cannot be inferred:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// // this
/// { panic!() };
///
/// // gets turned into this
/// { absurd(panic!()) }; // error: can't infer the type of `absurd`
/// ```
///
/// To prevent such errors, the compiler remembers where it inserted `absurd` calls, and
/// if it can't infer the type, it uses the fallback type instead:
/// ```rust, ignore
/// type Fallback = /* An arbitrarily selected type! */;
/// { absurd::<Fallback>(panic!()) }
/// ```
///
/// This is what is known as "never type fallback".
///
/// Historically, the fallback type was [`()`], causing confusing behavior where `!` spontaneously
/// coerced to `()`, even when it would not infer `()` without the fallback. There are plans to
/// change it in the [2024 edition] (and possibly in all editions on a later date); see
/// [Tracking Issue for making `!` fall back to `!`][fallback-ti].

/// A character type.
///
/// The `char` type represents a single character. More specifically, since
/// 'character' isn't a well-defined concept in Unicode, `char` is a '[Unicode
/// scalar value]'.
///
/// This documentation describes a number of methods and trait implementations on the
/// `char` type. For technical reasons, there is additional, separate
/// documentation in [the `std::char` module](char/index.html) as well.
///
/// # Validity and Layout
///
/// A `char` is a '[Unicode scalar value]', which is any '[Unicode code point]'
/// other than a [surrogate code point]. This has a fixed numerical definition:
/// code points are in the range 0 to 0x10FFFF, inclusive.
/// Surrogate code points, used by UTF-16, are in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF.
///
/// No `char` may be constructed, whether as a literal or at runtime, that is not a
/// Unicode scalar value. Violating this rule causes undefined behavior.
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// // Each of these is a compiler error
/// ['\u{D800}', '\u{DFFF}', '\u{110000}'];
/// ```
///
/// ```should_panic
/// // Panics; from_u32 returns None.
/// char::from_u32(0xDE01).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// ```no_run
/// // Undefined behavior
/// let _ = unsafe { char::from_u32_unchecked(0x110000) };
/// ```
///
/// Unicode scalar values are also the exact set of values that may be encoded in UTF-8. Because
/// `char` values are Unicode scalar values and functions may assume [incoming `str` values are
/// valid UTF-8](primitive.str.html#invariant), it is safe to store any `char` in a `str` or read
/// any character from a `str` as a `char`.
///
/// The gap in valid `char` values is understood by the compiler, so in the
/// below example the two ranges are understood to cover the whole range of
/// possible `char` values and there is no error for a [non-exhaustive match].
///
/// ```
/// let c: char = 'a';
/// match c {
///     '\0' ..= '\u{D7FF}' => false,
///     '\u{E000}' ..= '\u{10FFFF}' => true,
/// };
/// ```
///
/// All Unicode scalar values are valid `char` values, but not all of them represent a real
/// character. Many Unicode scalar values are not currently assigned to a character, but may be in
/// the future ("reserved"); some will never be a character ("noncharacters"); and some may be given
/// different meanings by different users ("private use").
///
/// `char` is guaranteed to have the same size, alignment, and function call ABI as `u32` on all
/// platforms.

///
/// # Representation
///
/// `char` is always four bytes in size. This is a different representation than
/// a given character would have as part of a [`String`]. For example:
///
/// ```
/// let v = vec!['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
///
/// // five elements times four bytes for each element
/// assert_eq!(20, v.len() * std::mem::size_of::<char>());
///
/// let s = String::from("hello");
///
/// // five elements times one byte per element
/// assert_eq!(5, s.len() * std::mem::size_of::<u8>());
/// ```
///
/// [`String`]: ../std/string/struct.String.html
///
/// As always, remember that a human intuition for 'character' might not map to
/// Unicode's definitions. For example, despite looking similar, the 'é'
/// character is one Unicode code point while 'é' is two Unicode code points:
///
/// ```
/// let mut chars = "é".chars();
/// // U+00e9: 'latin small letter e with acute'
/// assert_eq!(Some('\u{00e9}'), chars.next());
/// assert_eq!(None, chars.next());
///
/// let mut chars = "é".chars();
/// // U+0065: 'latin small letter e'
/// assert_eq!(Some('\u{0065}'), chars.next());
/// // U+0301: 'combining acute accent'
/// assert_eq!(Some('\u{0301}'), chars.next());
/// assert_eq!(None, chars.next());
/// ```
///
/// This means that the contents of the first string above _will_ fit into a
/// `char` while the contents of the second string _will not_. Trying to create
/// a `char` literal with the contents of the second string gives an error:
///
/// ```text
/// error: character literal may only contain one codepoint: 'é'
/// let c = 'é';
///         ^^^
/// ```
///
/// Another implication of the 4-byte fixed size of a `char` is that
/// per-`char` processing can end up using a lot more memory:
///
/// ```
/// let s = String::from("love: ❤️");
/// let v: Vec<char> = s.chars().collect();
///
/// assert_eq!(12, std::mem::size_of_val(&s[..]));
/// assert_eq!(32, std::mem::size_of_val(&v[..]));

/// Working with raw pointers in Rust is uncommon, typically limited to a few patterns. Raw pointers

/// pointer, it must be [valid] for the given access and aligned. When using a field expression,
/// tuple index expression, or array/slice index expression on a raw pointer, it follows the rules
/// of [in-bounds pointer arithmetic][`offset`].

/// Storing through a raw pointer using `*ptr = data` calls `drop` on the old value, so

/// [`is_null`] method of the `*const T` and `*mut T` types to check for null.
/// The `*const T` and `*mut T` types also define the [`offset`] method, for

/// ## 1. Coerce a reference (`&T`) or mutable reference (`&mut T`).
///
/// ```
/// let my_num: i32 = 10;
/// let my_num_ptr: *const i32 = &my_num;
/// let mut my_speed: i32 = 88;
/// let my_speed_ptr: *mut i32 = &mut my_speed;

/// let mut my_speed: Box<i32> = Box::new(88);
/// let my_speed_ptr: *mut i32 = &mut *my_speed;
/// ```
///
/// This does not take ownership of the original allocation
/// and requires no resource management later,
/// but you must not use the pointer after its lifetime.
///
/// ## 2. Consume a box (`Box<T>`).
///
/// The [`into_raw`] function consumes a box and returns
/// the raw pointer. It doesn't destroy `T` or deallocate any memory.
///
/// ```
/// let my_speed: Box<i32> = Box::new(88);

/// unsafe {
///     drop(Box::from_raw(my_speed));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that here the call to [`drop`] is for clarity - it indicates
/// that we are done with the given value and it should be destroyed.
///
/// ## 3. Create it using `ptr::addr_of!`
///
/// Instead of coercing a reference to a raw pointer, you can use the macros
/// [`ptr::addr_of!`] (for `*const T`) and [`ptr::addr_of_mut!`] (for `*mut T`).
/// These macros allow you to create raw pointers to fields to which you cannot
/// create a reference (without causing undefined behavior), such as an
/// unaligned field. This might be necessary if packed structs or uninitialized
/// memory is involved.

///     unaligned: u32,
/// }
/// let s = S::default();
/// let p = std::ptr::addr_of!(s.unaligned); // not allowed with coercion
/// ```
///
/// ## 4. Get it from C.
///
/// ```

/// [`IntoIterator`] by value. In the future, the behavior on the 2015 and 2018 edition
/// might be made consistent to the behavior of later editions.
///
/// ```rust,edition2018
/// // Rust 2015 and 2018:
///
/// # #![allow(array_into_iter)] // override our `deny(warnings)`

///
/// // This creates a slice iterator, producing references to each value.
/// for item in array.into_iter().enumerate() {
///     let (i, x): (usize, &i32) = item;
///     println!("array[{i}] = {x}");
/// }
///
/// // The `array_into_iter` lint suggests this change for future compatibility:
/// for item in array.iter().enumerate() {
///     let (i, x): (usize, &i32) = item;
///     println!("array[{i}] = {x}");
/// }
///
/// // You can explicitly iterate an array by value using `IntoIterator::into_iter`

///     let (i, x): (usize, i32) = item;
///     println!("array[{i}] = {x}");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Starting in the 2021 edition, `array.into_iter()` uses `IntoIterator` normally to iterate

/// ```rust,edition2021
/// // Rust 2021:

/// String literals are string slices:

///
/// # Representation
///

///   - It is not equal to any float, including itself! This is the reason `f32`

///   - It is also neither smaller nor greater than any float, making it
///     impossible to sort by the default comparison operation, which is the
///     reason `f32` doesn't implement the `Ord` trait.
///   - It is also considered *infectious* as almost all calculations where one
///     of the operands is NaN will also result in NaN. The explanations on this
///     page only explicitly document behavior on NaN operands if this default
///     is deviated from.
///   - Lastly, there are multiple bit patterns that are considered NaN.
///     Rust does not currently guarantee that the bit patterns of NaN are
///     preserved over arithmetic operations, and they are not guaranteed to be
///     portable or even fully deterministic! This means that there may be some
///     surprising results upon inspecting the bit patterns,
///     as the same calculations might produce NaNs with different bit patterns.
///     This also affects the sign of the NaN: checking `is_sign_positive` or `is_sign_negative` on

///     (Checking `x >= 0.0` or `x <= 0.0` avoids those surprises, but also how negative/positive

///     See the section below for what exactly is guaranteed about the bit pattern of a NaN.
///
/// When a primitive operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or

///   is a unique closest representable value.
/// - If the true value is exactly half-way between two representable values,

/// # NaN bit patterns
///
/// This section defines the possible NaN bit patterns returned by floating-point operations.
///
/// The bit pattern of a floating-point NaN value is defined by:
/// - a sign bit.
/// - a quiet/signaling bit. Rust assumes that the quiet/signaling bit being set to `1` indicates a
///   quiet NaN (QNaN), and a value of `0` indicates a signaling NaN (SNaN). In the following we
///   will hence just call it the "quiet bit".
/// - a payload, which makes up the rest of the significand (i.e., the mantissa) except for the
///   quiet bit.
///
/// The rules for NaN values differ between *arithmetic* and *non-arithmetic* (or "bitwise")
/// operations. The non-arithmetic operations are unary `-`, `abs`, `copysign`, `signum`,
/// `{to,from}_bits`, `{to,from}_{be,le,ne}_bytes` and `is_sign_{positive,negative}`. These
/// operations are guaranteed to exactly preserve the bit pattern of their input except for possibly
/// changing the sign bit.
///
/// The following rules apply when a NaN value is returned from an arithmetic operation:
/// - The result has a non-deterministic sign.
/// - The quiet bit and payload are non-deterministically chosen from
///   the following set of options:
///
///   - **Preferred NaN**: The quiet bit is set and the payload is all-zero.
///   - **Quieting NaN propagation**: The quiet bit is set and the payload is copied from any input
///     operand that is a NaN. If the inputs and outputs do not have the same payload size (i.e., for
///     `as` casts), then
///     - If the output is smaller than the input, low-order bits of the payload get dropped.
///     - If the output is larger than the input, the payload gets filled up with 0s in the low-order
///       bits.
///   - **Unchanged NaN propagation**: The quiet bit and payload are copied from any input operand
///     that is a NaN. If the inputs and outputs do not have the same size (i.e., for `as` casts), the
///     same rules as for "quieting NaN propagation" apply, with one caveat: if the output is smaller
///     than the input, dropping the low-order bits may result in a payload of 0; a payload of 0 is not
///     possible with a signaling NaN (the all-0 significand encodes an infinity) so unchanged NaN
///     propagation cannot occur with some inputs.
///   - **Target-specific NaN**: The quiet bit is set and the payload is picked from a target-specific
///     set of "extra" possible NaN payloads. The set can depend on the input operand values.
///     See the table below for the concrete NaNs this set contains on various targets.
///
/// In particular, if all input NaNs are quiet (or if there are no input NaNs), then the output NaN
/// is definitely quiet. Signaling NaN outputs can only occur if they are provided as an input
/// value. Similarly, if all input NaNs are preferred (or if there are no input NaNs) and the target
/// does not have any "extra" NaN payloads, then the output NaN is guaranteed to be preferred.
///
/// The non-deterministic choice happens when the operation is executed; i.e., the result of a
/// NaN-producing floating-point operation is a stable bit pattern (looking at these bits multiple
/// times will yield consistent results), but running the same operation twice with the same inputs
/// can produce different results.
///
/// These guarantees are neither stronger nor weaker than those of IEEE 754: IEEE 754 guarantees
/// that an operation never returns a signaling NaN, whereas it is possible for operations like
/// `SNAN * 1.0` to return a signaling NaN in Rust. Conversely, IEEE 754 makes no statement at all
/// about which quiet NaN is returned, whereas Rust restricts the set of possible results to the
/// ones listed above.
///
/// Unless noted otherwise, the same rules also apply to NaNs returned by other library functions
/// (e.g. `min`, `minimum`, `max`, `maximum`); other aspects of their semantics and which IEEE 754
/// operation they correspond to are documented with the respective functions.
///

/// # Safety
///
/// For all types, `T: ?Sized`, and for all `t: &T` or `t: &mut T`, when such values cross an API
/// boundary, the following invariants must generally be upheld:
///
/// * `t` is non-null
/// * `t` is aligned to `align_of_val(t)`
/// * if `size_of_val(t) > 0`, then `t` is dereferenceable for `size_of_val(t)` many bytes
///
/// If `t` points at address `a`, being "dereferenceable" for N bytes means that the memory range
/// `[a, a + N)` is all contained within a single [allocated object].
///
/// For instance, this means that unsafe code in a safe function may assume these invariants are
/// ensured of arguments passed by the caller, and it may assume that these invariants are ensured
/// of return values from any safe functions it calls.
///
/// For the other direction, things are more complicated: when unsafe code passes arguments
/// to safe functions or returns values from safe functions, they generally must *at least*
/// not violate these invariants. The full requirements are stronger, as the reference generally
/// must point to data that is safe to use at type `T`.
///
/// It is not decided yet whether unsafe code may violate these invariants temporarily on internal
/// data. As a consequence, unsafe code which violates these invariants temporarily on internal data
/// may be unsound or become unsound in future versions of Rust depending on how this question is
/// decided.
///
/// [allocated object]: ptr#allocated-object
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
mod prim_ref {}

#[rustc_doc_primitive = "fn"]
//
/// Function pointers, like `fn(usize) -> bool`.
///
/// *See also the traits [`Fn`], [`FnMut`], and [`FnOnce`].*
///
/// Function pointers are pointers that point to *code*, not data. They can be called
/// just like functions. Like references, function pointers are, among other things, assumed to
/// not be null, so if you want to pass a function pointer over FFI and be able to accommodate null
/// pointers, make your type [`Option<fn()>`](core::option#options-and-pointers-nullable-pointers)
/// with your required signature.
///
/// Note that FFI requires additional care to ensure that the ABI for both sides of the call match.
/// The exact requirements are not currently documented.
///
/// ### Safety
///
/// Plain function pointers are obtained by casting either plain functions, or closures that don't
/// capture an environment:
///
/// ```
/// fn add_one(x: usize) -> usize {
///     x + 1
/// }
///
/// let ptr: fn(usize) -> usize = add_one;
/// assert_eq!(ptr(5), 6);
///
/// let clos: fn(usize) -> usize = |x| x + 5;
/// assert_eq!(clos(5), 10);
/// ```
///
/// In addition to varying based on their signature, function pointers come in two flavors: safe
/// and unsafe. Plain `fn()` function pointers can only point to safe functions,
/// while `unsafe fn()` function pointers can point to safe or unsafe functions.
///
/// ```
/// fn add_one(x: usize) -> usize {
///     x + 1
/// }
///
/// unsafe fn add_one_unsafely(x: usize) -> usize {
///     x + 1
/// }
///
/// let safe_ptr: fn(usize) -> usize = add_one;
///
/// //ERROR: mismatched types: expected normal fn, found unsafe fn
/// //let bad_ptr: fn(usize) -> usize = add_one_unsafely;
///
/// let unsafe_ptr: unsafe fn(usize) -> usize = add_one_unsafely;
/// let really_safe_ptr: unsafe fn(usize) -> usize = add_one;
/// ```
///
/// ### ABI
///
/// On top of that, function pointers can vary based on what ABI they use. This
/// is achieved by adding the `extern` keyword before the type, followed by the
/// ABI in question. The default ABI is "Rust", i.e., `fn()` is the exact same
/// type as `extern "Rust" fn()`. A pointer to a function with C ABI would have
/// type `extern "C" fn()`.
///
/// `extern "ABI" { ... }` blocks declare functions with ABI "ABI". The default
/// here is "C", i.e., functions declared in an `extern {...}` block have "C"
/// ABI.
///
/// For more information and a list of supported ABIs, see [the nomicon's
/// section on foreign calling conventions][nomicon-abi].
///
/// [nomicon-abi]: ../nomicon/ffi.html#foreign-calling-conventions
///
/// ### Variadic functions
///
/// Extern function declarations with the "C" or "cdecl" ABIs can also be *variadic*, allowing them
/// to be called with a variable number of arguments. Normal Rust functions, even those with an
/// `extern "ABI"`, cannot be variadic. For more information, see [the nomicon's section on
/// variadic functions][nomicon-variadic].
///
/// [nomicon-variadic]: ../nomicon/ffi.html#variadic-functions
///
/// ### Creating function pointers
///
/// When `bar` is the name of a function, then the expression `bar` is *not* a
/// function pointer. Rather, it denotes a value of an unnameable type that
/// uniquely identifies the function `bar`. The value is zero-sized because the
/// type already identifies the function. This has the advantage that "calling"
/// the value (it implements the `Fn*` traits) does not require dynamic
/// dispatch.
///
/// This zero-sized type *coerces* to a regular function pointer. For example:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem;
///
/// fn bar(x: i32) {}
///
/// let not_bar_ptr = bar; // `not_bar_ptr` is zero-sized, uniquely identifying `bar`
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of_val(&not_bar_ptr), 0);
///
/// let bar_ptr: fn(i32) = not_bar_ptr; // force coercion to function pointer
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of_val(&bar_ptr), mem::size_of::<usize>());
///
/// let footgun = &bar; // this is a shared reference to the zero-sized type identifying `bar`
/// ```
///
/// The last line shows that `&bar` is not a function pointer either. Rather, it
/// is a reference to the function-specific ZST. `&bar` is basically never what you
/// want when `bar` is a function.
///
/// ### Casting to and from integers
///
/// You can cast function pointers directly to integers:
///
/// ```rust
/// let fnptr: fn(i32) -> i32 = |x| x+2;
/// let fnptr_addr = fnptr as usize;
/// ```
///
/// However, a direct cast back is not possible. You need to use `transmute`:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(not(miri))] { // FIXME: use strict provenance APIs once they are stable, then remove this `cfg`
/// # let fnptr: fn(i32) -> i32 = |x| x+2;
/// # let fnptr_addr = fnptr as usize;
/// let fnptr = fnptr_addr as *const ();
/// let fnptr: fn(i32) -> i32 = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(fnptr) };
/// assert_eq!(fnptr(40), 42);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Crucially, we `as`-cast to a raw pointer before `transmute`ing to a function pointer.
/// This avoids an integer-to-pointer `transmute`, which can be problematic.
/// Transmuting between raw pointers and function pointers (i.e., two pointer types) is fine.
///
/// Note that all of this is not portable to platforms where function pointers and data pointers
/// have different sizes.
///
/// ### ABI compatibility
///
/// Generally, when a function is declared with one signature and called via a function pointer with
/// a different signature, the two signatures must be *ABI-compatible* or else calling the function
/// via that function pointer is Undefined Behavior. ABI compatibility is a lot stricter than merely
/// having the same memory layout; for example, even if `i32` and `f32` have the same size and
/// alignment, they might be passed in different registers and hence not be ABI-compatible.
///
/// ABI compatibility as a concern only arises in code that alters the type of function pointers,
/// and code that imports functions via `extern` blocks. Altering the type of function pointers is
/// wildly unsafe (as in, a lot more unsafe than even [`transmute_copy`][mem::transmute_copy]), and
/// should only occur in the most exceptional circumstances. Most Rust code just imports functions
/// via `use`. So, most likely you do not have to worry about ABI compatibility.
///
/// But assuming such circumstances, what are the rules? For this section, we are only considering
/// the ABI of direct Rust-to-Rust calls (with both definition and callsite visible to the
/// Rust compiler), not linking in general -- once functions are imported via `extern` blocks, there
/// are more things to consider that we do not go into here. Note that this also applies to
/// passing/calling functions across language boundaries via function pointers.
///
/// **Nothing in this section should be taken as a guarantee for non-Rust-to-Rust calls, even with
/// types from `core::ffi` or `libc`**.
///
/// For two signatures to be considered *ABI-compatible*, they must use a compatible ABI string,
/// must take the same number of arguments, and the individual argument types and the return types
/// must be ABI-compatible. The ABI string is declared via `extern "ABI" fn(...) -> ...`; note that
/// `fn name(...) -> ...` implicitly uses the `"Rust"` ABI string and `extern fn name(...) -> ...`
/// implicitly uses the `"C"` ABI string.
///
/// The ABI strings are guaranteed to be compatible if they are the same, or if the caller ABI
/// string is `$X-unwind` and the callee ABI string is `$X`, where `$X` is one of the following:
/// "C", "aapcs", "fastcall", "stdcall", "system", "sysv64", "thiscall", "vectorcall", "win64".
///
/// The following types are guaranteed to be ABI-compatible:
///
/// - `*const T`, `*mut T`, `&T`, `&mut T`, `Box<T>` (specifically, only `Box<T, Global>`), and
///   `NonNull<T>` are all ABI-compatible with each other for all `T`. They are also ABI-compatible
///   with each other for _different_ `T` if they have the same metadata type (`<T as
///   Pointee>::Metadata`).
/// - `usize` is ABI-compatible with the `uN` integer type of the same size, and likewise `isize` is
///   ABI-compatible with the `iN` integer type of the same size.
/// - `char` is ABI-compatible with `u32`.
/// - Any two `fn` (function pointer) types are ABI-compatible with each other if they have the same
///   ABI string or the ABI string only differs in a trailing `-unwind`, independent of the rest of
///   their signature. (This means you can pass `fn()` to a function expecting `fn(i32)`, and the
///   call will be valid ABI-wise. The callee receives the result of transmuting the function pointer
///   from `fn()` to `fn(i32)`; that transmutation is itself a well-defined operation, it's just
///   almost certainly UB to later call that function pointer.)
/// - Any two types with size 0 and alignment 1 are ABI-compatible.
/// - A `repr(transparent)` type `T` is ABI-compatible with its unique non-trivial field, i.e., the
///   unique field that doesn't have size 0 and alignment 1 (if there is such a field).
/// - `i32` is ABI-compatible with `NonZero<i32>`, and similar for all other integer types.
/// - If `T` is guaranteed to be subject to the [null pointer
///   optimization](option/index.html#representation), and `E` is an enum satisfying the following
///   requirements, then `T` and `E` are ABI-compatible. Such an enum `E` is called "option-like".
///   - The enum `E` has exactly two variants.
///   - One variant has exactly one field, of type `T`.
///   - All fields of the other variant are zero-sized with 1-byte alignment.
///
/// Furthermore, ABI compatibility satisfies the following general properties:
///
/// - Every type is ABI-compatible with itself.
/// - If `T1` and `T2` are ABI-compatible and `T2` and `T3` are ABI-compatible, then so are `T1` and
///   `T3` (i.e., ABI-compatibility is transitive).
/// - If `T1` and `T2` are ABI-compatible, then so are `T2` and `T1` (i.e., ABI-compatibility is
///   symmetric).
///
/// More signatures can be ABI-compatible on specific targets, but that should not be relied upon
/// since it is not portable and not a stable guarantee.
///
/// Noteworthy cases of types *not* being ABI-compatible in general are:
/// * `bool` vs `u8`, `i32` vs `u32`, `char` vs `i32`: on some targets, the calling conventions for
///   these types differ in terms of what they guarantee for the remaining bits in the register that
///   are not used by the value.
/// * `i32` vs `f32` are not compatible either, as has already been mentioned above.
/// * `struct Foo(u32)` and `u32` are not compatible (without `repr(transparent)`) since structs are
///   aggregate types and often passed in a different way than primitives like `i32`.
///
/// Note that these rules describe when two completely known types are ABI-compatible. When
/// considering ABI compatibility of a type declared in another crate (including the standard
/// library), consider that any type that has a private field or the `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute
/// may change its layout as a non-breaking update unless documented otherwise -- so for instance,
/// even if such a type is a 1-ZST or `repr(transparent)` right now, this might change with any
/// library version bump.
///
/// If the declared signature and the signature of the function pointer are ABI-compatible, then the
/// function call behaves as if every argument was [`transmute`d][mem::transmute] from the
/// type in the function pointer to the type at the function declaration, and the return value is
/// [`transmute`d][mem::transmute] from the type in the declaration to the type in the
/// pointer. All the usual caveats and concerns around transmutation apply; for instance, if the
/// function expects a `NonZero<i32>` and the function pointer uses the ABI-compatible type
/// `Option<NonZero<i32>>`, and the value used for the argument is `None`, then this call is Undefined
/// Behavior since transmuting `None::<NonZero<i32>>` to `NonZero<i32>` violates the non-zero
/// requirement.
///
/// ### Trait implementations
///
/// In this documentation the shorthand `fn(T₁, T₂, …, Tₙ)` is used to represent non-variadic
/// function pointers of varying length. Note that this is a convenience notation to avoid
/// repetitive documentation, not valid Rust syntax.
///
/// The following traits are implemented for function pointers with any number of arguments and
/// any ABI.
///
/// * [`PartialEq`]
/// * [`Eq`]
/// * [`PartialOrd`]
/// * [`Ord`]
/// * [`Hash`]
/// * [`Pointer`]
/// * [`Debug`]
/// * [`Clone`]
/// * [`Copy`]
/// * [`Send`]
/// * [`Sync`]
/// * [`Unpin`]
/// * [`UnwindSafe`]
/// * [`RefUnwindSafe`]
///
/// Note that while this type implements `PartialEq`, comparing function pointers is unreliable:
/// pointers to the same function can compare inequal (because functions are duplicated in multiple
/// codegen units), and pointers to *different* functions can compare equal (since identical
/// functions can be deduplicated within a codegen unit).
///
/// [`Hash`]: hash::Hash
/// [`Pointer`]: fmt::Pointer
/// [`UnwindSafe`]: panic::UnwindSafe
/// [`RefUnwindSafe`]: panic::RefUnwindSafe
