Equivalent to C's `double` type.

This type will almost always be [`f64`], which is guaranteed to be an [IEEE 754 double-precision float] in Rust. That said, the standard technically only guarantees that it be a floating-point number with at least the precision of a [`float`], and it may be `f32` or something entirely different from the IEEE-754 standard.
