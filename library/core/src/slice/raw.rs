///
/// * `data` must be non-null, [valid] for reads for `len * mem::size_of::<T>()` many bytes,
///   and it must be properly aligned. This means in particular:
///
///     * The entire memory range of this slice must be contained within a single allocated object!
///       Slices can never span across multiple allocated objects. See [below](#incorrect-usage)
///       for an example incorrectly not taking this into account.
///     * `data` must be non-null and aligned even for zero-length slices or slices of ZSTs. One

/// # Caveat
///
/// The lifetime for the returned slice is inferred from its usage. To
/// prevent accidental misuse, it's suggested to tie the lifetime to whichever
/// source lifetime is safe in the context, such as by providing a helper
/// function taking the lifetime of a host value for the slice, or by explicit
/// annotation.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::slice;
///
/// // manifest a slice for a single element
/// let x = 42;
/// let ptr = &x as *const _;
/// let slice = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, 1) };
/// assert_eq!(slice[0], 42);
/// ```
///
/// ### Incorrect usage
///
/// The following `join_slices` function is **unsound** ⚠️
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::slice;
///
/// fn join_slices<'a, T>(fst: &'a [T], snd: &'a [T]) -> &'a [T] {
///     let fst_end = fst.as_ptr().wrapping_add(fst.len());
///     let snd_start = snd.as_ptr();
///     assert_eq!(fst_end, snd_start, "Slices must be contiguous!");
///     unsafe {
///         // The assertion above ensures `fst` and `snd` are contiguous, but they might
///         // still be contained within _different allocated objects_, in which case
///         // creating this slice is undefined behavior.
///         slice::from_raw_parts(fst.as_ptr(), fst.len() + snd.len())
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     // `a` and `b` are different allocated objects...
///     let a = 42;
///     let b = 27;
///     // ... which may nevertheless be laid out contiguously in memory: | a | b |
///     let _ = join_slices(slice::from_ref(&a), slice::from_ref(&b)); // UB
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### FFI: Handling null pointers
///
/// In languages such as C++, pointers to empty collections are not guaranteed to be non-null.
/// When accepting such pointers, they have to be checked for null-ness to avoid undefined
/// behavior.
///
/// ```
/// use std::slice;
///
/// /// Sum the elements of an FFI slice.
/// ///
/// /// # Safety
/// ///
/// /// If ptr is not NULL, it must be correctly aligned and
/// /// point to `len` initialized items of type `f32`.
/// unsafe extern "C" fn sum_slice(ptr: *const f32, len: usize) -> f32 {
///     let data = if ptr.is_null() {
///         // `len` is assumed to be 0.
///         &[]
///     } else {
///         // SAFETY: see function docstring.
///         unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len) }
///     };
///     data.into_iter().sum()
/// }
///
/// // This could be the result of C++'s std::vector::data():
/// let ptr = std::ptr::null();
/// // And this could be std::vector::size():
/// let len = 0;
/// assert_eq!(unsafe { sum_slice(ptr, len) }, 0.0);
