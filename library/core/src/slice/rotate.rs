/// Rotates the range `[mid-left, mid+right)` such that the element at `mid` becomes the first
/// element. Equivalently, rotates the range `left` elements to the left or `right` elements to the
/// right.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The specified range must be valid for reading and writing.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// Algorithm 1 is used for small values of `left + right` or for large `T`. The elements are moved
/// into their final positions one at a time starting at `mid - left` and advancing by `right` steps
/// modulo `left + right`, such that only one temporary is needed. Eventually, we arrive back at
/// `mid - left`. However, if `gcd(left + right, right)` is not 1, the above steps skipped over
/// elements. For example:
/// ```text
/// left = 10, right = 6
/// the `^` indicates an element in its final place
/// 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 . 0 1 2 3 4 5
/// after using one step of the above algorithm (The X will be overwritten at the end of the round,
/// and 12 is stored in a temporary):
/// X 7 8 9 10 11 6 13 14 15 . 0 1 2 3 4 5
///               ^
/// after using another step (now 2 is in the temporary):
/// X 7 8 9 10 11 6 13 14 15 . 0 1 12 3 4 5
///               ^                 ^
/// after the third step (the steps wrap around, and 8 is in the temporary):
/// X 7 2 9 10 11 6 13 14 15 . 0 1 12 3 4 5
///     ^         ^                 ^
/// after 7 more steps, the round ends with the temporary 0 getting put in the X:
/// 0 7 2 9 4 11 6 13 8 15 . 10 1 12 3 14 5
/// ^   ^   ^    ^    ^       ^    ^    ^
/// ```
/// Fortunately, the number of skipped over elements between finalized elements is always equal, so
/// we can just offset our starting position and do more rounds (the total number of rounds is the
/// `gcd(left + right, right)` value). The end result is that all elements are finalized once and
/// only once.
///
/// Algorithm 2 is used if `left + right` is large but `min(left, right)` is small enough to
/// fit onto a stack buffer. The `min(left, right)` elements are copied onto the buffer, `memmove`
/// is applied to the others, and the ones on the buffer are moved back into the hole on the
/// opposite side of where they originated.
///
/// Algorithms that can be vectorized outperform the above once `left + right` becomes large enough.
/// Algorithm 1 can be vectorized by chunking and performing many rounds at once, but there are too
/// few rounds on average until `left + right` is enormous, and the worst case of a single
/// round is always there. Instead, algorithm 3 utilizes repeated swapping of
/// `min(left, right)` elements until a smaller rotate problem is left.
///
/// ```text
/// left = 11, right = 4
/// [4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 . 0 1 2 3]
///                  ^  ^  ^  ^   ^ ^ ^ ^ swapping the right most elements with elements to the left
/// [4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . 0 1 2 3] 11 12 13 14
///        ^ ^ ^  ^   ^ ^ ^ ^ swapping these
/// [4 5 6 . 0 1 2 3] 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
/// we cannot swap any more, but a smaller rotation problem is left to solve
/// ```
/// when `left < right` the swapping happens from the left instead.
