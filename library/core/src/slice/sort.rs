//! Slice sorting
//!
//! This module contains a sorting algorithm based on Orson Peters' pattern-defeating quicksort,
//! published at: <https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort>
//!
//! Unstable sorting is compatible with libcore because it doesn't allocate memory, unlike our
//! stable sorting implementation.
