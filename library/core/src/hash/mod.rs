//! Generic hashing support.
//!
//! This module provides a generic way to compute the [hash] of a value.
//! Hashes are most commonly used with [`HashMap`] and [`HashSet`].
//!
//! [hash]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function
//! [`HashMap`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashMap.html
//! [`HashSet`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashSet.html
//!
//! The simplest way to make a type hashable is to use `#[derive(Hash)]`:
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hash, Hasher};
//!
//! #[derive(Hash)]
//! struct Person {
//!     id: u32,
//!     name: String,
//!     phone: u64,
//! }
//!
//! let person1 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Janet".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//! let person2 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Bob".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//!
//! assert!(calculate_hash(&person1) != calculate_hash(&person2));
//!
//! fn calculate_hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> u64 {
//!     let mut s = DefaultHasher::new();
//!     t.hash(&mut s);
//!     s.finish()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you need more control over how a value is hashed, you need to implement
//! the [`Hash`] trait:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hash, Hasher};
//!
//! struct Person {
//!     id: u32,
//!     # #[allow(dead_code)]
//!     name: String,
//!     phone: u64,
//! }
//!
//! impl Hash for Person {
//!     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
//!         self.id.hash(state);
//!         self.phone.hash(state);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let person1 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Janet".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//! let person2 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Bob".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(calculate_hash(&person1), calculate_hash(&person2));
//!
//! fn calculate_hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> u64 {
//!     let mut s = DefaultHasher::new();
//!     t.hash(&mut s);
//!     s.finish()
//! }
//! ```

/// A hashable type.
///
/// Types implementing `Hash` are able to be [`hash`]ed with an instance of
/// [`Hasher`].
///
/// ## Implementing `Hash`
///
/// You can derive `Hash` with `#[derive(Hash)]` if all fields implement `Hash`.
/// The resulting hash will be the combination of the values from calling
/// [`hash`] on each field.
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Hash)]
/// struct Rustacean {
///     name: String,
///     country: String,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you need more control over how a value is hashed, you can of course
/// implement the `Hash` trait yourself:
///
/// ```
/// use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
///
/// struct Person {
///     id: u32,
///     name: String,
///     phone: u64,
/// }
///
/// impl Hash for Person {
///     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
///         self.id.hash(state);
///         self.phone.hash(state);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## `Hash` and `Eq`
///
/// When implementing both `Hash` and [`Eq`], it is important that the following
/// property holds:
///
/// ```text
/// k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
/// ```
///
/// In other words, if two keys are equal, their hashes must also be equal.
/// [`HashMap`] and [`HashSet`] both rely on this behavior.
///
/// Thankfully, you won't need to worry about upholding this property when
/// deriving both [`Eq`] and `Hash` with `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`.
///
/// Violating this property is a logic error. The behavior resulting from a logic error is not
/// specified, but users of the trait must ensure that such logic errors do *not* result in
/// undefined behavior. This means that `unsafe` code **must not** rely on the correctness of these
/// methods.
///
/// ## Prefix collisions
///
/// Implementations of `hash` should ensure that the data they
/// pass to the `Hasher` are prefix-free. That is,
/// values which are not equal should cause two different sequences of values to be written,
/// and neither of the two sequences should be a prefix of the other.
///
/// For example, the standard implementation of [`Hash` for `&str`][impl] passes an extra
/// `0xFF` byte to the `Hasher` so that the values `("ab", "c")` and `("a",
/// "bc")` hash differently.
///
/// ## Portability
///
/// Due to differences in endianness and type sizes, data fed by `Hash` to a `Hasher`
/// should not be considered portable across platforms. Additionally the data passed by most
/// standard library types should not be considered stable between compiler versions.
///
/// This means tests shouldn't probe hard-coded hash values or data fed to a `Hasher` and
/// instead should check consistency with `Eq`.
///
/// Serialization formats intended to be portable between platforms or compiler versions should
/// either avoid encoding hashes or only rely on `Hash` and `Hasher` implementations that
/// provide additional guarantees.
///

/// A trait for hashing an arbitrary stream of bytes.

/// Instances of `Hasher` usually represent state that is changed while hashing
/// data.
///
/// `Hasher` provides a fairly basic interface for retrieving the generated hash
/// (with [`finish`]), and writing integers as well as slices of bytes into an
/// instance (with [`write`] and [`write_u8`] etc.). Most of the time, `Hasher`
/// instances are used in conjunction with the [`Hash`] trait.
///
/// This trait provides no guarantees about how the various `write_*` methods are
/// defined and implementations of [`Hash`] should not assume that they work one
/// way or another. You cannot assume, for example, that a [`write_u32`] call is
/// equivalent to four calls of [`write_u8`].  Nor can you assume that adjacent
/// `write` calls are merged, so it's possible, for example, that
/// ```
/// # fn foo(hasher: &mut impl std::hash::Hasher) {
/// hasher.write(&[1, 2]);
/// hasher.write(&[3, 4, 5, 6]);
/// # }
/// ```

/// hasher.write(&[1, 2, 3, 4]);
/// hasher.write(&[5, 6]);

/// A trait for creating instances of [`Hasher`].
///
/// A `BuildHasher` is typically used (e.g., by [`HashMap`]) to create
/// [`Hasher`]s for each key such that they are hashed independently of one
/// another, since [`Hasher`]s contain state.
///
/// For each instance of `BuildHasher`, the [`Hasher`]s created by
/// [`build_hasher`] should be identical. That is, if the same stream of bytes
/// is fed into each hasher, the same output will also be generated.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::hash::{BuildHasher, Hasher, RandomState};
///
/// let s = RandomState::new();
/// let mut hasher_1 = s.build_hasher();
/// let mut hasher_2 = s.build_hasher();
///
/// hasher_1.write_u32(8128);
/// hasher_2.write_u32(8128);
///
/// assert_eq!(hasher_1.finish(), hasher_2.finish());
/// ```
