/// A future represents an asynchronous computation obtained by use of [`async`].
///
/// A future is a value that might not have finished computing yet. This kind of
/// "asynchronous value" makes it possible for a thread to continue doing useful
/// work while it waits for the value to become available.
///
/// # The `poll` method
///
/// The core method of future, `poll`, *attempts* to resolve the future into a
/// final value. This method does not block if the value is not ready. Instead,
/// the current task is scheduled to be woken up when it's possible to make
/// further progress by `poll`ing again. The `context` passed to the `poll`
/// method can provide a [`Waker`], which is a handle for waking up the current
/// task.
///
/// When using a future, you generally won't call `poll` directly, but instead
/// `.await` the value.

    /// This function returns:
    ///
    /// - [`Poll::Pending`] if the future is not ready yet
    /// - [`Poll::Ready(val)`] with the result `val` of this future if it
    ///   finished successfully.
    ///
    /// Once a future has finished, clients should not `poll` it again.
    ///
    /// When a future is not ready yet, `poll` returns `Poll::Pending` and
    /// stores a clone of the [`Waker`] copied from the current [`Context`].
    /// This [`Waker`] is then woken once the future can make progress.
    /// For example, a future waiting for a socket to become
    /// readable would call `.clone()` on the [`Waker`] and store it.
    /// When a signal arrives elsewhere indicating that the socket is readable,
    /// [`Waker::wake`] is called and the socket future's task is awoken.
    /// Once a task has been woken up, it should attempt to `poll` the future
    /// again, which may or may not produce a final value.
    ///
    /// Note that on multiple calls to `poll`, only the [`Waker`] from the
    /// [`Context`] passed to the most recent call should be scheduled to
    /// receive a wakeup.
    ///
    /// # Runtime characteristics
    ///
    /// Futures alone are *inert*; they must be *actively* `poll`ed to make
    /// progress, meaning that each time the current task is woken up, it should
    /// actively re-`poll` pending futures that it still has an interest in.
    ///
    /// The `poll` function is not called repeatedly in a tight loop -- instead,
    /// it should only be called when the future indicates that it is ready to
    /// make progress (by calling `wake()`). If you're familiar with the
    /// `poll(2)` or `select(2)` syscalls on Unix it's worth noting that futures
    /// typically do *not* suffer the same problems of "all wakeups must poll
    /// all events"; they are more like `epoll(4)`.
    ///
    /// An implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and should
    /// not block. Returning quickly prevents unnecessarily clogging up
    /// threads or event loops. If it is known ahead of time that a call to
    /// `poll` may end up taking a while, the work should be offloaded to a
    /// thread pool (or something similar) to ensure that `poll` can return
    /// quickly.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// Once a future has completed (returned `Ready` from `poll`), calling its
    /// `poll` method again may panic, block forever, or cause other kinds of
    /// problems; the `Future` trait places no requirements on the effects of
    /// such a call. However, as the `poll` method is not marked `unsafe`,
    /// Rust's usual rules apply: calls must never cause undefined behavior
    /// (memory corruption, incorrect use of `unsafe` functions, or the like),
    /// regardless of the future's state.
