/// When a value is no longer needed, Rust will run a "destructor" on that value.
/// The most common way that a value is no longer needed is when it goes out of
/// scope. Destructors may still run in other circumstances, but we're going to
/// focus on scope for the examples here. To learn about some of those other cases,
/// please see [the reference] section on destructors.

/// ## `Copy` and ([`Drop`]|`AsyncDrop`) are exclusive
///
/// You cannot implement both [`Copy`] and ([`Drop`]|`AsyncDrop`) on the same type. Types that
/// are `Copy` get implicitly duplicated by the compiler, making it very
/// hard to predict when, and how often destructors will be executed. As such,
/// these types cannot have destructors.
