//! Compiler intrinsics.
//!
//! The corresponding definitions are in <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/intrinsic.rs>.
//! The corresponding const implementations are in <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/intrinsics.rs>.
//!
//! # Const intrinsics
//!
//! Note: any changes to the constness of intrinsics should be discussed with the language team.
//! This includes changes in the stability of the constness.
//!
//! In order to make an intrinsic usable at compile-time, it needs to be declared in the "new"
//! style, i.e. as a `#[rustc_intrinsic]` function, not inside an `extern` block. Then copy the
//! implementation from <https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/blob/master/src/shims/intrinsics> to
//! <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/intrinsics.rs>
//! and make the intrinsic declaration a `const fn`.
//!
//! If an intrinsic is supposed to be used from a `const fn` with a `rustc_const_stable` attribute,
//! `#[rustc_intrinsic_const_stable_indirect]` needs to be added to the intrinsic. Such a change requires
//! T-lang approval, because it may bake a feature into the language that cannot be replicated in
//! user code without compiler support.
//!
//! # Volatiles
//!
//! The volatile intrinsics provide operations intended to act on I/O
//! memory, which are guaranteed to not be reordered by the compiler
//! across other volatile intrinsics. See the LLVM documentation on
//! [[volatile]].
//!
//! [volatile]: https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#volatile-memory-accesses
//!
//! # Atomics
//!
//! The atomic intrinsics provide common atomic operations on machine
//! words, with multiple possible memory orderings. They obey the same
//! semantics as C++11. See the LLVM documentation on [[atomics]].
//!
//! [atomics]: https://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html
//!
//! A quick refresher on memory ordering:
//!
//! * Acquire - a barrier for acquiring a lock. Subsequent reads and writes
//!   take place after the barrier.
//! * Release - a barrier for releasing a lock. Preceding reads and writes
//!   take place before the barrier.
//! * Sequentially consistent - sequentially consistent operations are
//!   guaranteed to happen in order. This is the standard mode for working
//!   with atomic types and is equivalent to Java's `volatile`.
//!
//! # Unwinding
//!
//! Rust intrinsics may, in general, unwind. If an intrinsic can never unwind, add the
//! `#[rustc_nounwind]` attribute so that the compiler can make use of this fact.
//!
//! However, even for intrinsics that may unwind, rustc assumes that a Rust intrinsics will never
//! initiate a foreign (non-Rust) unwind, and thus for panic=abort we can always assume that these
//! intrinsics cannot unwind.

///
/// Because `transmute` is a by-value operation, alignment of the *transmuted values

/// # Transmutation between pointers and integers
///
/// Special care has to be taken when transmuting between pointers and integers, e.g.
/// transmuting between `*const ()` and `usize`.
///
/// Transmuting *pointers to integers* in a `const` context is [undefined behavior][ub], unless
/// the pointer was originally created *from* an integer. (That includes this function
/// specifically, integer-to-pointer casts, and helpers like [`dangling`][crate::ptr::dangling],
/// but also semantically-equivalent conversions such as punning through `repr(C)` union
/// fields.) Any attempt to use the resulting value for integer operations will abort
/// const-evaluation. (And even outside `const`, such transmutation is touching on many
/// unspecified aspects of the Rust memory model and should be avoided. See below for
/// alternatives.)
///
/// Transmuting *integers to pointers* is a largely unspecified operation. It is likely *not*
/// equivalent to an `as` cast. Doing non-zero-sized memory accesses with a pointer constructed
/// this way is currently considered undefined behavior.
///
/// All this also applies when the integer is nested inside an array, tuple, struct, or enum.
/// However, `MaybeUninit<usize>` is not considered an integer type for the purpose of this
/// section. Transmuting `*const ()` to `MaybeUninit<usize>` is fine---but then calling
/// `assume_init()` on that result is considered as completing the pointer-to-integer transmute
/// and thus runs into the issues discussed above.
///
/// In particular, doing a pointer-to-integer-to-pointer roundtrip via `transmute` is *not* a
/// lossless process. If you want to round-trip a pointer through an integer in a way that you
/// can get back the original pointer, you need to use `as` casts, or replace the integer type
/// by `MaybeUninit<$int>` (and never call `assume_init()`). If you are looking for a way to
/// store data of arbitrary type, also use `MaybeUninit<T>` (that will also handle uninitialized
/// memory due to padding). If you specifically need to store something that is "either an
/// integer or a pointer", use `*mut ()`: integers can be converted to pointers and back without
/// any loss (via `as` casts or via `transmute`).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// There are a few things that `transmute` is really useful for.
///
/// Turning a pointer into a function pointer. This is *not* portable to
/// machines where function pointers and data pointers have different sizes.
///
/// ```
/// fn foo() -> i32 {
///     0
/// }
/// // Crucially, we `as`-cast to a raw pointer before `transmute`ing to a function pointer.
/// // This avoids an integer-to-pointer `transmute`, which can be problematic.
/// // Transmuting between raw pointers and function pointers (i.e., two pointer types) is fine.
/// let pointer = foo as *const ();
/// let function = unsafe {
///     std::mem::transmute::<*const (), fn() -> i32>(pointer)
/// };
/// assert_eq!(function(), 0);
/// ```
///
/// Extending a lifetime, or shortening an invariant lifetime. This is
/// advanced, very unsafe Rust!
///
/// ```
/// struct R<'a>(&'a i32);
/// unsafe fn extend_lifetime<'b>(r: R<'b>) -> R<'static> {
///     std::mem::transmute::<R<'b>, R<'static>>(r)
/// }

/// # Alternatives
///

/// in the general case: an `if is_val_statically_known(var)` can be used
/// to select between these two variants. The `if` will be optimized away
/// and only the desired branch remains.
///
/// Formally speaking, this function non-deterministically returns `true`
/// or `false`, and the caller has to ensure sound behavior for both cases.
/// In other words, the following code has *Undefined Behavior*:
///
/// ```no_run
/// #![feature(core_intrinsics)]
/// # #![allow(internal_features)]
/// use std::hint::unreachable_unchecked;
/// use std::intrinsics::is_val_statically_known;
///
/// if !is_val_statically_known(0) { unsafe { unreachable_unchecked(); } }
/// ```
///

/// may panic, or it may not:
///
/// ```no_run
/// #![feature(core_intrinsics)]
/// # #![allow(internal_features)]
/// use std::intrinsics::is_val_statically_known;
///
/// assert_eq!(is_val_statically_known(0), is_val_statically_known(0));
/// ```
///
/// Unsafe code may not rely on `is_val_statically_known` returning any
/// particular value, ever. However, the compiler will generally make it
/// return `true` only if the value of the argument is actually known.
///
/// # Stability concerns
///
/// While it is safe to call, this intrinsic may behave differently in
/// a `const` context than otherwise. See the [`const_eval_select()`]
/// documentation for an explanation of the issues this can cause. Unlike
/// `const_eval_select`, this intrinsic isn't guaranteed to behave
/// deterministically even in a `const` context.
///
/// # Type Requirements
///
/// `T` must be either a `bool`, a `char`, a primitive numeric type (e.g. `f32`,
/// but not `NonZeroISize`), or any thin pointer (e.g. `*mut String`).
/// Any other argument types *may* cause a compiler error.
///
/// ## Pointers
///
/// When the input is a pointer, only the pointer itself is
/// ever considered. The pointee has no effect. Currently, these functions
/// behave identically:
