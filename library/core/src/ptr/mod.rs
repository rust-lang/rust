//! Manually manage memory through raw pointers.
//!
//! *[See also the pointer primitive types](pointer).*
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Many functions in this module take raw pointers as arguments and read from or write to them. For
//! this to be safe, these pointers must be *valid* for the given access. Whether a pointer is valid
//! depends on the operation it is used for (read or write), and the extent of the memory that is
//! accessed (i.e., how many bytes are read/written) -- it makes no sense to ask "is this pointer
//! valid"; one has to ask "is this pointer valid for a given access". Most functions use `*mut T`
//! and `*const T` to access only a single value, in which case the documentation omits the size and
//! implicitly assumes it to be `size_of::<T>()` bytes.
//!
//! The precise rules for validity are not determined yet. The guarantees that are
//! provided at this point are very minimal:
//!
//! * For operations of [size zero][zst], *every* pointer is valid, including the [null] pointer.
//!   The following points are only concerned with non-zero-sized accesses.
//! * A [null] pointer is *never* valid.
//! * For a pointer to be valid, it is necessary, but not always sufficient, that the pointer be
//!   *dereferenceable*. The [provenance] of the pointer is used to determine which [allocated
//!   object] it is derived from; a pointer is dereferenceable if the memory range of the given size
//!   starting at the pointer is entirely contained within the bounds of that allocated object. Note
//!   that in Rust, every (stack-allocated) variable is considered a separate allocated object.
//! * All accesses performed by functions in this module are *non-atomic* in the sense
//!   of [atomic operations] used to synchronize between threads. This means it is
//!   undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location from different
//!   threads unless both accesses only read from memory. Notice that this explicitly
//!   includes [`read_volatile`] and [`write_volatile`]: Volatile accesses cannot
//!   be used for inter-thread synchronization.
//! * The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the
//!   underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to
//!   access the same memory. That is, reference and pointer accesses cannot be
//!   interleaved.
//!
//! These axioms, along with careful use of [`offset`] for pointer arithmetic,
//! are enough to correctly implement many useful things in unsafe code. Stronger guarantees
//! will be provided eventually, as the [aliasing] rules are being determined. For more
//! information, see the [book] as well as the section in the reference devoted
//! to [undefined behavior][ub].
//!
//! We say that a pointer is "dangling" if it is not valid for any non-zero-sized accesses. This
//! means out-of-bounds pointers, pointers to freed memory, null pointers, and pointers created with
//! [`NonNull::dangling`] are all dangling.
//!
//! ## Alignment
//!
//! Valid raw pointers as defined above are not necessarily properly aligned (where
//! "proper" alignment is defined by the pointee type, i.e., `*const T` must be
//! aligned to `mem::align_of::<T>()`). However, most functions require their
//! arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state
//! this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are
//! [`read_unaligned`] and [`write_unaligned`].
//!
//! When a function requires proper alignment, it does so even if the access
//! has size 0, i.e., even if memory is not actually touched. Consider using
//! [`NonNull::dangling`] in such cases.
//!
//! ## Pointer to reference conversion
//!
//! When converting a pointer to a reference (e.g. via `&*ptr` or `&mut *ptr`),
//! there are several rules that must be followed:
//!
//! * The pointer must be properly aligned.
//!
//! * It must be non-null.
//!
//! * It must be "dereferenceable" in the sense defined above.
//!
//! * The pointer must point to a [valid value] of type `T`.
//!
//! * You must enforce Rust's aliasing rules. The exact aliasing rules are not decided yet, so we
//!   only give a rough overview here. The rules also depend on whether a mutable or a shared
//!   reference is being created.
//!   * When creating a mutable reference, then while this reference exists, the memory it points to
//!     must not get accessed (read or written) through any other pointer or reference not derived
//!     from this reference.
//!   * When creating a shared reference, then while this reference exists, the memory it points to
//!     must not get mutated (except inside `UnsafeCell`).
//!
//! If a pointer follows all of these rules, it is said to be
//! *convertible to a (mutable or shared) reference*.
// ^ we use this term instead of saying that the produced reference must
// be valid, as the validity of a reference is easily confused for the
// validity of the thing it refers to, and while the two concepts are
// closly related, they are not identical.
//!
//! These rules apply even if the result is unused!
//! (The part about being initialized is not yet fully decided, but until
//! it is, the only safe approach is to ensure that they are indeed initialized.)
//!
//! An example of the implications of the above rules is that an expression such
//! as `unsafe { &*(0 as *const u8) }` is Immediate Undefined Behavior.
//!
//! [valid value]: ../../reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html#invalid-values
//!
//! ## Allocated object
//!
//! An *allocated object* is a subset of program memory which is addressable
//! from Rust, and within which pointer arithmetic is possible. Examples of
//! allocated objects include heap allocations, stack-allocated variables,
//! statics, and consts. The safety preconditions of some Rust operations -
//! such as `offset` and field projections (`expr.field`) - are defined in
//! terms of the allocated objects on which they operate.
//!
//! An allocated object has a base address, a size, and a set of memory
//! addresses. It is possible for an allocated object to have zero size, but
//! such an allocated object will still have a base address. The base address
//! of an allocated object is not necessarily unique. While it is currently the
//! case that an allocated object always has a set of memory addresses which is
//! fully contiguous (i.e., has no "holes"), there is no guarantee that this
//! will not change in the future.
//!
//! For any allocated object with `base` address, `size`, and a set of
//! `addresses`, the following are guaranteed:
//! - For all addresses `a` in `addresses`, `a` is in the range `base .. (base +
//!   size)` (note that this requires `a < base + size`, not `a <= base + size`)
//! - `base` is not equal to [`null()`] (i.e., the address with the numerical
//!   value 0)
//! - `base + size <= usize::MAX`
//! - `size <= isize::MAX`
//!
//! As a consequence of these guarantees, given any address `a` within the set
//! of addresses of an allocated object:
//! - It is guaranteed that `a - base` does not overflow `isize`
//! - It is guaranteed that `a - base` is non-negative
//! - It is guaranteed that, given `o = a - base` (i.e., the offset of `a` within
//!   the allocated object), `base + o` will not wrap around the address space (in
//!   other words, will not overflow `usize`)
//!
//! [`null()`]: null
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Pointers are not *simply* an "integer" or "address". For instance, it's uncontroversial
//! to say that a Use After Free is clearly Undefined Behavior, even if you "get lucky"
//! and the freed memory gets reallocated before your read/write (in fact this is the
//! worst-case scenario, UAFs would be much less concerning if this didn't happen!).
//! As another example, consider that [`wrapping_offset`] is documented to "remember"
//! the allocated object that the original pointer points to, even if it is offset far
//! outside the memory range occupied by that allocated object.
//! To rationalize claims like this, pointers need to somehow be *more* than just their addresses:
//! they must have **provenance**.
//!
//! A pointer value in Rust semantically contains the following information:
//!
//! * The **address** it points to, which can be represented by a `usize`.
//! * The **provenance** it has, defining the memory it has permission to access. Provenance can be
//!   absent, in which case the pointer does not have permission to access any memory.
//!
//! The exact structure of provenance is not yet specified, but the permission defined by a
//! pointer's provenance have a *spatial* component, a *temporal* component, and a *mutability*
//! component:
//!
//! * Spatial: The set of memory addresses that the pointer is allowed to access.
//! * Temporal: The timespan during which the pointer is allowed to access those memory addresses.
//! * Mutability: Whether the pointer may only access the memory for reads, or also access it for
//!   writes. Note that this can interact with the other components, e.g. a pointer might permit
//!   mutation only for a subset of addresses, or only for a subset of its maximal timespan.
//!
//! When an [allocated object] is created, it has a unique Original Pointer. For alloc
//! APIs this is literally the pointer the call returns, and for local variables and statics,
//! this is the name of the variable/static. (This is mildly overloading the term "pointer"
//! for the sake of brevity/exposition.)
//!
//! The Original Pointer for an allocated object has provenance that constrains the *spatial*
//! permissions of this pointer to the memory range of the allocation, and the *temporal*
//! permissions to the lifetime of the allocation. Provenance is implicitly inherited by all
//! pointers transitively derived from the Original Pointer through operations like [`offset`],
//! borrowing, and pointer casts. Some operations may *shrink* the permissions of the derived
//! provenance, limiting how much memory it can access or how long it's valid for (i.e. borrowing a
//! subfield and subslicing can shrink the spatial component of provenance, and all borrowing can
//! shrink the temporal component of provenance). However, no operation can ever *grow* the
//! permissions of the derived provenance: even if you "know" there is a larger allocation, you
//! can't derive a pointer with a larger provenance. Similarly, you cannot "recombine" two
//! contiguous provenances back into one (i.e. with a `fn merge(&[T], &[T]) -> &[T]`).
//!
//! A reference to a place always has provenance over at least the memory that place occupies.
//! A reference to a slice always has provenance over at least the range that slice describes.
//! Whether and when exactly the provenance of a reference gets "shrunk" to *exactly* fit
//! the memory it points to is not yet determined.
//!
//! A *shared* reference only ever has provenance that permits reading from memory,
//! and never permits writes, except inside [`UnsafeCell`].
//!
//! Provenance can affect whether a program has undefined behavior:
//!
//! * It is undefined behavior to access memory through a pointer that does not have provenance over
//!   that memory. Note that a pointer "at the end" of its provenance is not actually outside its
//!   provenance, it just has 0 bytes it can load/store. Zero-sized accesses do not require any
//!   provenance since they access an empty range of memory.
//!
//! * It is undefined behavior to [`offset`] a pointer across a memory range that is not contained
//!   in the allocated object it is derived from, or to [`offset_from`] two pointers not derived
//!   from the same allocated object. Provenance is used to say what exactly "derived from" even
//!   means: the lineage of a pointer is traced back to the Original Pointer it descends from, and
//!   that identifies the relevant allocated object. In particular, it's always UB to offset a
//!   pointer derived from something that is now deallocated, except if the offset is 0.
//!
//! But it *is* still sound to:
//!
//! * Create a pointer without provenance from just an address (see [`ptr::dangling`]). Such a
//!   pointer cannot be used for memory accesses (except for zero-sized accesses). This can still be
//!   useful for sentinel values like `null` *or* to represent a tagged pointer that will never be
//!   dereferenceable. In general, it is always sound for an integer to pretend to be a pointer "for
//!   fun" as long as you don't use operations on it which require it to be valid (non-zero-sized
//!   offset, read, write, etc).
//!
//! * Forge an allocation of size zero at any sufficiently aligned non-null address.
//!   i.e. the usual "ZSTs are fake, do what you want" rules apply.
//!
//! * [`wrapping_offset`] a pointer outside its provenance. This includes pointers
//!   which have "no" provenance. In particular, this makes it sound to do pointer tagging tricks.
//!
//! * Compare arbitrary pointers by address. Pointer comparison ignores provenance and addresses
//!   *are* just integers, so there is always a coherent answer, even if the pointers are dangling
//!   or from different provenances. Note that if you get "lucky" and notice that a pointer at the
//!   end of one allocated object is the "same" address as the start of another allocated object,
//!   anything you do with that fact is *probably* going to be gibberish. The scope of that
//!   gibberish is kept under control by the fact that the two pointers *still* aren't allowed to
//!   access the other's allocation (bytes), because they still have different provenance.
//!
//! Note that the full definition of provenance in Rust is not decided yet, as this interacts
//! with the as-yet undecided [aliasing] rules.
//!
//! ## Pointers Vs Integers
//!
//! From this discussion, it becomes very clear that a `usize` *cannot* accurately represent a pointer,
//! and converting from a pointer to a `usize` is generally an operation which *only* extracts the
//! address. Converting this address back into pointer requires somehow answering the question:
//! which provenance should the resulting pointer have?
//!
//! Rust provides two ways of dealing with this situation: *Strict Provenance* and *Exposed Provenance*.
//!
//! Note that a pointer *can* represent a `usize` (via [`without_provenance`]), so the right type to
//! use in situations where a value is "sometimes a pointer and sometimes a bare `usize`" is a
//! pointer type.
//!
//! ## Strict Provenance
//!
//! "Strict Provenance" refers to a set of APIs designed to make working with provenance more
//! explicit. They are intended as substitutes for casting a pointer to an integer and back.
//!
//! Entirely avoiding integer-to-pointer casts successfully side-steps the inherent ambiguity of
//! that operation. This benefits compiler optimizations, and it is pretty much a requirement for
//! using tools like [Miri] and architectures like [CHERI] that aim to detect and diagnose pointer
//! misuse.
//!
//! The key insight to making programming without integer-to-pointer casts *at all* viable is the
//! [`with_addr`] method:
//!
//! ```text
//!     /// Creates a new pointer with the given address.
//!     ///
//!     /// This performs the same operation as an `addr as ptr` cast, but copies
//!     /// the *provenance* of `self` to the new pointer.
//!     /// This allows us to dynamically preserve and propagate this important
//!     /// information in a way that is otherwise impossible with a unary cast.
//!     ///
//!     /// This is equivalent to using `wrapping_offset` to offset `self` to the
//!     /// given address, and therefore has all the same capabilities and restrictions.
//!     pub fn with_addr(self, addr: usize) -> Self;
//! ```
//!
//! So you're still able to drop down to the address representation and do whatever
//! clever bit tricks you want *as long as* you're able to keep around a pointer
//! into the allocation you care about that can "reconstitute" the provenance.
//! Usually this is very easy, because you only are taking a pointer, messing with the address,
//! and then immediately converting back to a pointer. To make this use case more ergonomic,
//! we provide the [`map_addr`] method.
//!
//! To help make it clear that code is "following" Strict Provenance semantics, we also provide an
//! [`addr`] method which promises that the returned address is not part of a
//! pointer-integer-pointer roundtrip. In the future we may provide a lint for pointer<->integer
//! casts to help you audit if your code conforms to strict provenance.
//!
//! ### Using Strict Provenance
//!
//! Most code needs no changes to conform to strict provenance, as the only really concerning
//! operation is casts from usize to a pointer. For code which *does* cast a `usize` to a pointer,
//! the scope of the change depends on exactly what you're doing.
//!
//! In general, you just need to make sure that if you want to convert a `usize` address to a
//! pointer and then use that pointer to read/write memory, you need to keep around a pointer
//! that has sufficient provenance to perform that read/write itself. In this way all of your
//! casts from an address to a pointer are essentially just applying offsets/indexing.
//!
//! This is generally trivial to do for simple cases like tagged pointers *as long as you
//! represent the tagged pointer as an actual pointer and not a `usize`*. For instance:
//!
//! ```
//! unsafe {
//!     // A flag we want to pack into our pointer
//!     static HAS_DATA: usize = 0x1;
//!     static FLAG_MASK: usize = !HAS_DATA;
//!
//!     // Our value, which must have enough alignment to have spare least-significant-bits.
//!     let my_precious_data: u32 = 17;
//!     assert!(core::mem::align_of::<u32>() > 1);
//!
//!     // Create a tagged pointer
//!     let ptr = &my_precious_data as *const u32;
//!     let tagged = ptr.map_addr(|addr| addr | HAS_DATA);
//!
//!     // Check the flag:
//!     if tagged.addr() & HAS_DATA != 0 {
//!         // Untag and read the pointer
//!         let data = *tagged.map_addr(|addr| addr & FLAG_MASK);
//!         assert_eq!(data, 17);
//!     } else {
//!         unreachable!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! (Yes, if you've been using AtomicUsize for pointers in concurrent datastructures, you should
//! be using AtomicPtr instead. If that messes up the way you atomically manipulate pointers,
//! we would like to know why, and what needs to be done to fix it.)
//!
//! Situations where a valid pointer *must* be created from just an address, such as baremetal code
//! accessing a memory-mapped interface at a fixed address, cannot currently be handled with strict
//! provenance APIs and should use [exposed provenance](#exposed-provenance).
//!
//! ## Exposed Provenance
//!
//! As discussed above, integer-to-pointer casts are not possible with Strict Provenance APIs.
//! This is by design: the goal of Strict Provenance is to provide a clear specification that we are
//! confident can be formalized unambiguously and can be subject to precise formal reasoning.
//! Integer-to-pointer casts do not (currently) have such a clear specification.
//!
//! However, there exist situations where integer-to-pointer casts cannot be avoided, or
//! where avoiding them would require major refactoring. Legacy platform APIs also regularly assume
//! that `usize` can capture all the information that makes up a pointer.
//! Bare-metal platforms can also require the synthesis of a pointer "out of thin air" without
//! anywhere to obtain proper provenance from.
//!
//! Rust's model for dealing with integer-to-pointer casts is called *Exposed Provenance*. However,
//! the semantics of Exposed Provenance are on much less solid footing than Strict Provenance, and
//! at this point it is not yet clear whether a satisfying unambiguous semantics can be defined for
//! Exposed Provenance. (If that sounds bad, be reassured that other popular languages that provide
//! integer-to-pointer casts are not faring any better.) Furthermore, Exposed Provenance will not
//! work (well) with tools like [Miri] and [CHERI].
//!
//! Exposed Provenance is provided by the [`expose_provenance`] and [`with_exposed_provenance`] methods,
//! which are equivalent to `as` casts between pointers and integers.
//! - [`expose_provenance`] is a lot like [`addr`], but additionally adds the provenance of the
//!   pointer to a global list of 'exposed' provenances. (This list is purely conceptual, it exists
//!   for the purpose of specifying Rust but is not materialized in actual executions, except in
//!   tools like [Miri].)
//!   Memory which is outside the control of the Rust abstract machine (MMIO registers, for example)
//!   is always considered to be exposed, so long as this memory is disjoint from memory that will
//!   be used by the abstract machine such as the stack, heap, and statics.
//! - [`with_exposed_provenance`] can be used to construct a pointer with one of these previously
//!   'exposed' provenances. [`with_exposed_provenance`] takes only `addr: usize` as arguments, so
//!   unlike in [`with_addr`] there is no indication of what the correct provenance for the returned
//!   pointer is -- and that is exactly what makes integer-to-pointer casts so tricky to rigorously
//!   specify! The compiler will do its best to pick the right provenance for you, but currently we
//!   cannot provide any guarantees about which provenance the resulting pointer will have. Only one
//!   thing is clear: if there is *no* previously 'exposed' provenance that justifies the way the
//!   returned pointer will be used, the program has undefined behavior.
//!
//! If at all possible, we encourage code to be ported to [Strict Provenance] APIs, thus avoiding
//! the need for Exposed Provenance. Maximizing the amount of such code is a major win for avoiding
//! specification complexity and to facilitate adoption of tools like [CHERI] and [Miri] that can be
//! a big help in increasing the confidence in (unsafe) Rust code. However, we acknowledge that this
//! is not always possible, and offer Exposed Provenance as a way to explicit "opt out" of the
//! well-defined semantics of Strict Provenance, and "opt in" to the unclear semantics of
//! integer-to-pointer casts.

    // provides enough information to know that this is a typed operation.

    // However, as of March 2023 the compiler was not capable of taking advantage
    // of that information. Thus, the implementation here switched to an intrinsic,
    // which lowers to `_0 = *src` in MIR, to address a few issues:
    //
    // - Using `MaybeUninit::assume_init` after a `copy_nonoverlapping` was not
    //   turning the untyped copy into a typed load. As such, the generated
    //   `load` in LLVM didn't get various metadata, such as `!range` (#73258),
    //   `!nonnull`, and `!noundef`, resulting in poorer optimization.
    // - Going through the extra local resulted in multiple extra copies, even
    //   in optimized MIR.  (Ignoring StorageLive/Dead, the intrinsic is one
    //   MIR statement, while the previous implementation was eight.)  LLVM
    //   could sometimes optimize them away, but because `read` is at the core
    //   of so many things, not having them in the first place improves what we
    //   hand off to the backend.  For example, `mem::replace::<Big>` previously
    //   emitted 4 `alloca` and 6 `memcpy`s, but is now 1 `alloc` and 3 `memcpy`s.
    // - In general, this approach keeps us from getting any more bugs (like
    //   #106369) that boil down to "`read(p)` is worse than `*p`", as this
    //   makes them look identical to the backend (or other MIR consumers).
