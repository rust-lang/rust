    /// Returns `true` if the pointer is null.
    ///
    /// Note that unsized types have many possible null pointers, as only the
    /// raw data pointer is considered, not their length, vtable, etc.
    /// Therefore, two pointers that are null may still not compare equal to
    /// each other.
    ///
    /// ## Behavior during const evaluation
    ///
    /// When this function is used during const evaluation, it may return `false` for pointers
    /// that turn out to be null at runtime. Specifically, when a pointer to some memory
    /// is offset beyond its bounds in such a way that the resulting pointer is null,
    /// the function will still return `false`. There is no way for CTFE to know
    /// the absolute position of that memory, so we cannot tell if the pointer is
    /// null or not.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Basic usage:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let mut s = [1, 2, 3];
    /// let ptr: *mut u32 = s.as_mut_ptr();
