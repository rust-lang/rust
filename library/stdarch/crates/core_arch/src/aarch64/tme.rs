//! ARM's Transactional Memory Extensions (TME).
//!
//! This CPU feature is available on Aarch64 - A architecture profile.
//! This feature is in the non-neon feature set. TME specific vendor documentation can
//! be found [TME Intrinsics Introduction][tme_intrinsics_intro].
//!
//! The reference is [ACLE Q4 2019][acle_q4_2019_ref].
//!
//! ACLE has a section for TME extensions and state masks for aborts and failure codes.
//! [ARM A64 Architecture Register Datasheet][a_profile_future] also describes possible failure code scenarios.
