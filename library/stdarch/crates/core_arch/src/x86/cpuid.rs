/// There are 2 types of information leafs - basic leafs (with `leaf < 0x8000000`)
/// and extended leafs (with `leaf >= 0x80000000`). The highest supported basic and
/// extended leafs can be obtained by calling CPUID with `0` and `0x80000000`, 
/// respectively, and reading the value in the `EAX` register. If the leaf supports
/// more than one sub-leafs, then the procedure of obtaining the highest supported
/// sub-leaf, as well as the behavior if a invalid sub-leaf value is passed, depends
/// on the specific leaf.
/// 
/// If the `leaf` value is higher than the maximum supported basic or extended leaf 
/// for the processor, this returns the information for the highest supported basic 
/// information leaf (with the passed `sub_leaf` value). If the `leaf` value is less 
/// than or equal to the highest basic or extended leaf value, but the leaf is not 
/// supported on the processor, all zeros are returned.
///
/// The [CPUID Wikipedia page][wiki_cpuid] contains how to query which
/// information using the `EAX` and `ECX` registers, and the interpretation of
/// the results returned in `EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, and `EDX`.
