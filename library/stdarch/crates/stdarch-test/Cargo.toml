# We use a crates.io dependency to disassemble wasm binaries to look for
# instructions for `#[assert_instr]`. Note that we use an `=` dependency here
# instead of a floating dependency because the text format for wasm changes over
# time, and we want to make updates to this explicit rather than automatically
# picking up updates which might break CI with new instruction names.
