//! Inplace iterate-and-collect specialization for `Vec`
//!
//! Note: This documents Vec internals, some of the following sections explain implementation
//! details and are best read together with the source of this module.
//!
//! The specialization in this module applies to iterators in the shape of
//! `source.adapter().adapter().adapter().collect::<Vec<U>>()`
//! where `source` is an owning iterator obtained from [`Vec<T>`], [`Box<[T]>`][box] (by conversion to `Vec`)
//! or [`BinaryHeap<T>`], the adapters guarantee to consume enough items per step to make room
//! for the results (represented by [`InPlaceIterable`]), provide transitive access to `source`
//! (via [`SourceIter`]) and thus the underlying allocation.
//! And finally there are alignment and size constraints to consider, this is currently ensured via
//! const eval instead of trait bounds in the specialized [`SpecFromIter`] implementation.
//!
//! [`BinaryHeap<T>`]: crate::collections::BinaryHeap
//! [box]: crate::boxed::Box
//!
//! By extension some other collections which use `collect::<Vec<_>>()` internally in their
//! `FromIterator` implementation benefit from this too.
//!
//! Access to the underlying source goes through a further layer of indirection via the private
//! trait [`AsVecIntoIter`] to hide the implementation detail that other collections may use
//! `vec::IntoIter` internally.
//!
//! In-place iteration depends on the interaction of several unsafe traits, implementation
//! details of multiple parts in the iterator pipeline and often requires holistic reasoning
//! across multiple structs since iterators are executed cooperatively rather than having
//! a central evaluator/visitor struct executing all iterator components.
//!
//! # Reading from and writing to the same allocation
//!
//! By its nature collecting in place means that the reader and writer side of the iterator
//! use the same allocation. Since `try_fold()` (used in [`SpecInPlaceCollect`]) takes a
//! reference to the iterator for the duration of the iteration that means we can't interleave
//! the step of reading a value and getting a reference to write to. Instead raw pointers must be
//! used on the reader and writer side.
//!
//! That writes never clobber a yet-to-be-read items is ensured by the [`InPlaceIterable`] requirements.
//!
//! # Layout constraints
//!
//! When recycling an allocation between different types we must uphold the [`Allocator`] contract
//! which means that the input and output Layouts have to "fit".
//!
//! To complicate things further `InPlaceIterable` supports splitting or merging items into smaller/
//! larger ones to enable (de)aggregation of arrays.
//!
//! Ultimately each step of the iterator must free up enough *bytes* in the source to make room
//! for the next output item.
//! If `T` and `U` have the same size no fixup is needed.
//! If `T`'s size is a multiple of `U`'s we can compensate by multiplying the capacity accordingly.
//! Otherwise the input capacity (and thus layout) in bytes may not be representable by the output
//! `Vec<U>`. In that case `alloc.shrink()` is used to update the allocation's layout.
//!
//! Alignments of `T` must be the same or larger than `U`. Since alignments are always a power
//! of two _larger_ implies _is a multiple of_.
//!
//! See `in_place_collectible()` for the current conditions.
//!
//! Additionally this specialization doesn't make sense for ZSTs as there is no reallocation to
//! avoid and it would make pointer arithmetic more difficult.
//!
//! [`Allocator`]: core::alloc::Allocator
//!
//! # Drop- and panic-safety
//!
//! Iteration can panic, requiring dropping the already written parts but also the remainder of
//! the source. Iteration can also leave some source items unconsumed which must be dropped.
//! All those drops in turn can panic which then must either leak the allocation or abort to avoid
//! double-drops.
//!
//! This is handled by the [`InPlaceDrop`] guard for sink items (`U`) and by
//! [`vec::IntoIter::forget_allocation_drop_remaining()`] for remaining source items (`T`).
//!
//! If dropping any remaining source item (`T`) panics then [`InPlaceDstDataSrcBufDrop`] will handle dropping
//! the already collected sink items (`U`) and freeing the allocation.
//!
//! [`vec::IntoIter::forget_allocation_drop_remaining()`]: super::IntoIter::forget_allocation_drop_remaining()
//!
//! # O(1) collect
//!
//! The main iteration itself is further specialized when the iterator implements
//! [`TrustedRandomAccessNoCoerce`] to let the optimizer see that it is a counted loop with a single
//! [induction variable]. This can turn some iterators into a noop, i.e. it reduces them from O(n) to
//! O(1). This particular optimization is quite fickle and doesn't always work, see [#79308]
//!
//! [#79308]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79308
//! [induction variable]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_variable
//!
//! Since unchecked accesses through that trait do not advance the read pointer of `IntoIter`
//! this would interact unsoundly with the requirements about dropping the tail described above.
//! But since the normal `Drop` implementation of `IntoIter` would suffer from the same problem it
//! is only correct for `TrustedRandomAccessNoCoerce` to be implemented when the items don't
//! have a destructor. Thus that implicit requirement also makes the specialization safe to use for
//! in-place collection.
//! Note that this safety concern is about the correctness of `impl Drop for IntoIter`,
//! not the guarantees of `InPlaceIterable`.
//!
//! # Adapter implementations
//!
//! The invariants for adapters are documented in [`SourceIter`] and [`InPlaceIterable`], but
//! getting them right can be rather subtle for multiple, sometimes non-local reasons.
//! For example `InPlaceIterable` would be valid to implement for [`Peekable`], except
//! that it is stateful, cloneable and `IntoIter`'s clone implementation shortens the underlying
//! allocation which means if the iterator has been peeked and then gets cloned there no longer is
//! enough room, thus breaking an invariant ([#85322]).
//!
//! [#85322]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85322
//! [`Peekable`]: core::iter::Peekable
//!
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Some cases that are optimized by this specialization, more can be found in the `Vec`
//! benchmarks:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[allow(dead_code)]
//! /// Converts a usize vec into an isize one.
//! pub fn cast(vec: Vec<usize>) -> Vec<isize> {
//!   // Does not allocate, free or panic. On optlevel>=2 it does not loop.
//!   // Of course this particular case could and should be written with `into_raw_parts` and
//!   // `from_raw_parts` instead.
//!   vec.into_iter().map(|u| u as isize).collect()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[allow(dead_code)]
//! /// Drops remaining items in `src` and if the layouts of `T` and `U` match it
//! /// returns an empty Vec backed by the original allocation. Otherwise it returns a new
//! /// empty vec.
//! pub fn recycle_allocation<T, U>(src: Vec<T>) -> Vec<U> {
//!   src.into_iter().filter_map(|_| None).collect()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust
//! let vec = vec![13usize; 1024];
//! let _ = vec.into_iter()
//!   .enumerate()
//!   .filter_map(|(idx, val)| if idx % 2 == 0 { Some(val+idx) } else {None})
//!   .collect::<Vec<_>>();
//!
//! // is equivalent to the following, but doesn't require bounds checks
//!
//! let mut vec = vec![13usize; 1024];
//! let mut write_idx = 0;
//! for idx in 0..vec.len() {
//!    if idx % 2 == 0 {
//!       vec[write_idx] = vec[idx] + idx;
//!       write_idx += 1;
//!    }
//! }
//! vec.truncate(write_idx);
//! ```
