//! The `Box<T>` type for heap allocation.
//!
//! [`Box<T>`], casually referred to as a 'box', provides the simplest form of
//! heap allocation in Rust. Boxes provide ownership for this allocation, and
//! drop their contents when they go out of scope. Boxes also ensure that they
//! never allocate more than `isize::MAX` bytes.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Move a value from the stack to the heap by creating a [`Box`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let val: u8 = 5;
//! let boxed: Box<u8> = Box::new(val);
//! ```
//!
//! Move a value from a [`Box`] back to the stack by [dereferencing]:
//!
//! ```
//! let boxed: Box<u8> = Box::new(5);
//! let val: u8 = *boxed;
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a recursive data structure:
//!
//! ```
//! ##[allow(dead_code)]
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! enum List<T> {
//!     Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
//!     Nil,
//! }
//!
//! let list: List<i32> = List::Cons(1, Box::new(List::Cons(2, Box::new(List::Nil))));
//! println!("{list:?}");
//! ```
//!
//! This will print `Cons(1, Cons(2, Nil))`.
//!
//! Recursive structures must be boxed, because if the definition of `Cons`
//! looked like this:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0072
//! # enum List<T> {
//! Cons(T, List<T>),
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! It wouldn't work. This is because the size of a `List` depends on how many
//! elements are in the list, and so we don't know how much memory to allocate
//! for a `Cons`. By introducing a [`Box<T>`], which has a defined size, we know how
//! big `Cons` needs to be.
//!
//! # Memory layout
//!
//! For non-zero-sized values, a [`Box`] will use the [`Global`] allocator for its allocation. It is
//! valid to convert both ways between a [`Box`] and a raw pointer allocated with the [`Global`]
//! allocator, given that the [`Layout`] used with the allocator is correct for the type and the raw
//! pointer points to a valid value of the right type. More precisely, a `value: *mut T` that has
//! been allocated with the [`Global`] allocator with `Layout::for_value(&*value)` may be converted
//! into a box using [`Box::<T>::from_raw(value)`]. Conversely, the memory backing a `value: *mut T`
//! obtained from [`Box::<T>::into_raw`] may be deallocated using the [`Global`] allocator with
//! [`Layout::for_value(&*value)`].
//!
//! For zero-sized values, the `Box` pointer has to be non-null and sufficiently aligned. The
//! recommended way to build a Box to a ZST if `Box::new` cannot be used is to use
//! [`ptr::NonNull::dangling`].
//!
//! On top of these basic layout requirements, a `Box<T>` must point to a valid value of `T`.
//!
//! So long as `T: Sized`, a `Box<T>` is guaranteed to be represented
//! as a single pointer and is also ABI-compatible with C pointers
//! (i.e. the C type `T*`). This means that if you have extern "C"
//! Rust functions that will be called from C, you can define those
//! Rust functions using `Box<T>` types, and use `T*` as corresponding
//! type on the C side. As an example, consider this C header which
//! declares functions that create and destroy some kind of `Foo`
//! value:
//!
//! ```c
//! /* C header */
//!
//! /* Returns ownership to the caller */
//! struct Foo* foo_new(void);
//!
//! /* Takes ownership from the caller; no-op when invoked with null */
//! void foo_delete(struct Foo*);
//! ```
//!
//! These two functions might be implemented in Rust as follows. Here, the
//! `struct Foo*` type from C is translated to `Box<Foo>`, which captures
//! the ownership constraints. Note also that the nullable argument to
//! `foo_delete` is represented in Rust as `Option<Box<Foo>>`, since `Box<Foo>`
//! cannot be null.
//!
//! ```
//! #[repr(C)]
//! pub struct Foo;
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn foo_new() -> Box<Foo> {
//!     Box::new(Foo)
//! }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn foo_delete(_: Option<Box<Foo>>) {}
//! ```
//!
//! Even though `Box<T>` has the same representation and C ABI as a C pointer,
//! this does not mean that you can convert an arbitrary `T*` into a `Box<T>`
//! and expect things to work. `Box<T>` values will always be fully aligned,
//! non-null pointers. Moreover, the destructor for `Box<T>` will attempt to
//! free the value with the global allocator. In general, the best practice
//! is to only use `Box<T>` for pointers that originated from the global
//! allocator.
//!
//! **Important.** At least at present, you should avoid using
//! `Box<T>` types for functions that are defined in C but invoked
//! from Rust. In those cases, you should directly mirror the C types
//! as closely as possible. Using types like `Box<T>` where the C
//! definition is just using `T*` can lead to undefined behavior, as
//! described in [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#198][ucg#198].
//!
//! # Considerations for unsafe code
//!
//! **Warning: This section is not normative and is subject to change, possibly
//! being relaxed in the future! It is a simplified summary of the rules
//! currently implemented in the compiler.**
//!
//! The aliasing rules for `Box<T>` are the same as for `&mut T`. `Box<T>`
//! asserts uniqueness over its content. Using raw pointers derived from a box
//! after that box has been mutated through, moved or borrowed as `&mut T`
//! is not allowed. For more guidance on working with box from unsafe code, see
//! [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#326][ucg#326].
//!
//! # Editions
//!
//! A special case exists for the implementation of `IntoIterator` for arrays on the Rust 2021
//! edition, as documented [here][array]. Unfortunately, it was later found that a similar
//! workaround should be added for boxed slices, and this was applied in the 2024 edition.
//!
//! Specifically, `IntoIterator` is implemented for `Box<[T]>` on all editions, but specific calls
//! to `into_iter()` for boxed slices will defer to the slice implementation on editions before
//! 2024:
//!
//! ```rust,edition2021
//! // Rust 2015, 2018, and 2021:
//!
//! # #![allow(boxed_slice_into_iter)] // override our `deny(warnings)`
//! let boxed_slice: Box<[i32]> = vec![0; 3].into_boxed_slice();
//!
//! // This creates a slice iterator, producing references to each value.
//! for item in boxed_slice.into_iter().enumerate() {
//!     let (i, x): (usize, &i32) = item;
//!     println!("boxed_slice[{i}] = {x}");
//! }
//!
//! // The `boxed_slice_into_iter` lint suggests this change for future compatibility:
//! for item in boxed_slice.iter().enumerate() {
//!     let (i, x): (usize, &i32) = item;
//!     println!("boxed_slice[{i}] = {x}");
//! }
//!
//! // You can explicitly iterate a boxed slice by value using `IntoIterator::into_iter`
//! for item in IntoIterator::into_iter(boxed_slice).enumerate() {
//!     let (i, x): (usize, i32) = item;
//!     println!("boxed_slice[{i}] = {x}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Similar to the array implementation, this may be modified in the future to remove this override,
//! and it's best to avoid relying on this edition-dependent behavior if you wish to preserve
//! compatibility with future versions of the compiler.

/* Nota bene
 *
 *  We could have chosen not to add this impl, and instead have written a
 *  function of Pin<Box<T>> to Pin<T>. Such a function would not be sound,
 *  because Box<T> implements Unpin even when T does not, as a result of
 *  this impl.
 *
 *  We chose this API instead of the alternative for a few reasons:
 *      - Logically, it is helpful to understand pinning in regard to the
 *        memory region being pointed to. For this reason none of the
 *        standard library pointer types support projecting through a pin
 *        (Box<T> is the only pointer type in std for which this would be
 *        safe.)
 *      - It is in practice very useful to have Box<T> be unconditionally
 *        Unpin because of trait objects, for which the structural auto
 *        trait functionality does not apply (e.g., Box<dyn Foo> would
 *        otherwise not be Unpin).
 *
 *  Another type with the same semantics as Box but only a conditional
 *  implementation of `Unpin` (where `T: Unpin`) would be valid/safe, and
 *  could have a method to project a Pin<T> from it.
