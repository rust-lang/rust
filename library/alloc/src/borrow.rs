/// The type `Cow` is a smart pointer providing clone-on-write functionality: it
/// can enclose and provide immutable access to borrowed data, and clone the
/// data lazily when mutation or ownership is required. The type is designed to
/// work with general borrowed data via the `Borrow` trait.
///
/// `Cow` implements `Deref`, which means that you can call
/// non-mutating methods directly on the data it encloses. If mutation
/// is desired, `to_mut` will obtain a mutable reference to an owned
/// value, cloning if necessary.
///
/// If you need reference-counting pointers, note that
/// [`Rc::make_mut`][crate::rc::Rc::make_mut] and
/// [`Arc::make_mut`][crate::sync::Arc::make_mut] can provide clone-on-write
/// functionality as well.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::borrow::Cow;
///
/// fn abs_all(input: &mut Cow<'_, [i32]>) {
///     for i in 0..input.len() {
///         let v = input[i];
///         if v < 0 {
///             // Clones into a vector if not already owned.
///             input.to_mut()[i] = -v;
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // No clone occurs because `input` doesn't need to be mutated.
/// let slice = [0, 1, 2];
/// let mut input = Cow::from(&slice[..]);
/// abs_all(&mut input);
///
/// // Clone occurs because `input` needs to be mutated.
/// let slice = [-1, 0, 1];
/// let mut input = Cow::from(&slice[..]);
/// abs_all(&mut input);
///
/// // No clone occurs because `input` is already owned.
/// let mut input = Cow::from(vec![-1, 0, 1]);
/// abs_all(&mut input);

///
/// ```
/// use std::borrow::Cow;

/// struct Items<'a, X> where [X]: ToOwned<Owned = Vec<X>> {
