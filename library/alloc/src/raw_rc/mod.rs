//! Base implementation for `rc::{Rc, UniqueRc, Weak}` and `sync::{Arc, UniqueArc, Weak}`.
//!
//! # Allocation Memory Layout
//!
//! The memory layout of a reference-counted allocation is designed so that the memory that stores
//! the reference counts has a fixed offset to the memory that stores the value. In this way,
//! operations that only rely on reference counts can ignore the actual type of the contained value
//! and only care about the address of the contained value, which allows us to share code between
//! reference-counting pointers that have different types of contained values. This can potentially
//! reduce the binary size.
//!
//! Assume the type of the stored value is `T`, the allocation memory layout is designed as follows:
//!
//! - We use a `RefCounts` type to store the reference counts.
//! - The alignment of the allocation is `align_of::<RefCounts>().max(align_of::<T>())`.
//! - The value is stored at offset `size_of::<RefCounts>().next_multiple_of(align_of::<T>())`.
//! - The size of the allocation is
//!   `size_of::<RefCounts>().next_multiple_of(align_of::<T>()) + size_of::<T>()`.
//! - The `RefCounts` object is stored at offset
//!   `size_of::<RefCounts>().next_multiple_of(align_of::<T>()) - size_of::<RefCounts>()`.
//!
//! Here is a table showing the order and size of each component in an reference counted allocation
//! of a `T` value:
//!
//! | Component   | Size                                                                                |
//! | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
//! | Padding     | `size_of::<RefCounts>().next_multiple_of(align_of::<T>()) - size_of::<RefCounts>()` |
//! | `RefCounts` | `size_of::<RefCounts>()`                                                            |
//! | `T`         | `size_of::<T>()`                                                                    |
//!
//! This works because:
//!
//! - Both `RefCounts` and the object is stored in the allocation without overlapping.
//! - The `RefCounts` object is stored at offset
//!   `size_of::<RefCounts>().next_multiple_of(align_of::<T>()) - size_of::<RefCounts>()`, which
//!   has a valid alignment for `RefCounts` because:
//!   - If `align_of::<T>() <= align_of::<RefCounts>()`, we have the offset being 0, which has a
//!     valid alignment for `RefCounts`.
//!   - If `align_of::<T>() > align_of::<RefCounts>()`, we have `align_of::<T>()` being a multiple
//!     of `align_of::<RefCounts>()`, since `size_of::<RefCounts>()` is also a multiple of
//!    `align_of::<RefCounts>()`, we conclude the offset also has a valid alignment for `RefCounts`.
//! - The value is stored at offset `size_of::<RefCounts>().next_multiple_of(align_of::<T>())`,
//!   which trivially satisfies the alignment requirement of `T`.
//! - The distance between the `RefCounts` object and the value is `size_of::<RefCounts>()`, a fixed
//!   value.
//!
//! So both the `RefCounts` object and the value object have their alignment and size requirements
//! satisfied. And we get a fixed offset between those two objects.
//!
//! # Reference-counting Pointer Design
//!
//! Both strong and weak reference-counting pointers store a pointer that points to the value
//! object in a reference-counted allocation, instead of a pointer to the beginning of the
//! allocation. This is based on the assumption that users access the contained value more
//! frequently than the reference counters. Also, this possibly allows us to enable some
//! optimizations like:
//!
//! - Making reference-counting pointers have ABI-compatible representation as raw pointers so we
//!   can use them directly in FFI interfaces.
//! - Converting `Option<Rc<T>>` to `Option<&T>` without checking for `None` values.
//! - Converting `&[Rc<T>]` to `&[&T]` with zero cost.
