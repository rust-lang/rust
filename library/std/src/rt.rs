//
// # The `sigpipe` parameter
//
// Since 2014, the Rust runtime on Unix has set the `SIGPIPE` handler to
// `SIG_IGN`. Applications have good reasons to want a different behavior
// though, so there is a `-Zon-broken-pipe` compiler flag that
// can be used to select how `SIGPIPE` shall be setup (if changed at all) before
// `fn main()` is called. See <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97889>
// for more info.
//
// The `sigpipe` parameter to this function gets its value via the code that
// rustc generates to invoke `fn lang_start()`. The reason we have `sigpipe` for
// all platforms and not only Unix, is because std is not allowed to have `cfg`
// directives as this high level. See the module docs in
// `src/tools/tidy/src/pal.rs` for more info. On all other platforms, `sigpipe`
// has a value, but its value is ignored.
//
// Even though it is an `u8`, it only ever has 4 values. These are documented in
// `compiler/rustc_session/src/config/sigpipe.rs`.
