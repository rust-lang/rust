//! Networking primitives for TCP/UDP communication.
//!
//! This module provides networking functionality for the Transmission Control and User
//! Datagram Protocols, as well as types for IP and socket addresses.
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! * [`TcpListener`] and [`TcpStream`] provide functionality for communication over TCP
//! * [`UdpSocket`] provides functionality for communication over UDP
//! * [`IpAddr`] represents IP addresses of either IPv4 or IPv6; [`Ipv4Addr`] and
//!   [`Ipv6Addr`] are respectively IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
//! * [`SocketAddr`] represents socket addresses of either IPv4 or IPv6; [`SocketAddrV4`]
//!   and [`SocketAddrV6`] are respectively IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses
//! * [`ToSocketAddrs`] is a trait that is used for generic address resolution when interacting
//!   with networking objects like [`TcpListener`], [`TcpStream`] or [`UdpSocket`]
//! * Other types are return or parameter types for various methods in this module
//!
//! Rust disables inheritance of socket objects to child processes by default when possible.  For
//! example, through the use of the `CLOEXEC` flag in UNIX systems or the `HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT`
//! flag on Windows.
