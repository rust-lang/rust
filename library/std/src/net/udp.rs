///
/// After creating a `UdpSocket` by [`bind`]ing it to a socket address, data can be
/// [sent to] and [received from] any other socket address.
///
/// Although UDP is a connectionless protocol, this implementation provides an interface
/// to set an address where data should be sent and received from. After setting a remote
/// address with [`connect`], data can be sent to and received from that address with
/// [`send`] and [`recv`].
///
/// As stated in the User Datagram Protocol's specification in [IETF RFC 768], UDP is
/// an unordered, unreliable protocol; refer to [`TcpListener`] and [`TcpStream`] for TCP
/// primitives.

/// [`bind`]: UdpSocket::bind
/// [`connect`]: UdpSocket::connect
/// [IETF RFC 768]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768
