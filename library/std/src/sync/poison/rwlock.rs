/// A reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// In comparison, a [`Mutex`] does not distinguish between readers or writers
/// that acquire the lock, therefore blocking any threads waiting for the lock to
/// become available. An `RwLock` will allow any number of readers to acquire the
/// lock as long as a writer is not holding the lock.
///
/// The priority policy of the lock is dependent on the underlying operating
/// system's implementation, and this type does not guarantee that any
/// particular policy will be used. In particular, a writer which is waiting to
/// acquire the lock in `write` might or might not block concurrent calls to
/// `read`, e.g.:
///
/// <details><summary>Potential deadlock example</summary>
///
/// ```text
/// // Thread 1              |  // Thread 2
/// let _rg1 = lock.read();  |
///                          |  // will block
///                          |  let _wg = lock.write();
/// // may deadlock          |
/// let _rg2 = lock.read();  |
/// ```
///
/// </details>
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies [`Send`] to be shared across threads and
/// [`Sync`] to allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards
/// returned from the locking methods implement [`Deref`] (and [`DerefMut`]
/// for the `write` methods) to allow access to the content of the lock.
///
/// # Poisoning
///
/// An `RwLock`, like [`Mutex`], will [usually] become poisoned on a panic. Note,
/// however, that an `RwLock` may only be poisoned if a panic occurs while it is
/// locked exclusively (write mode). If a panic occurs in any reader, then the
/// lock will not be poisoned.
///
/// [usually]: super::Mutex#poisoning
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::RwLock;
///
/// let lock = RwLock::new(5);
///
/// // many reader locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read().unwrap();
///     let r2 = lock.read().unwrap();
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
/// } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
/// // only one write lock may be held, however
/// {
///     let mut w = lock.write().unwrap();
///     *w += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
/// } // write lock is dropped here
/// ```
