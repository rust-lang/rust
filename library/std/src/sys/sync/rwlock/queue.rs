//! Efficient read-write locking without `pthread_rwlock_t`.
//!
//! The readers-writer lock provided by the `pthread` library has a number of problems which make it
//! a suboptimal choice for `std`:
//!
//! * It is non-movable, so it needs to be allocated (lazily, to make the constructor `const`).
//! * `pthread` is an external library, meaning the fast path of acquiring an uncontended lock
//! cannot be inlined.
//! * Some platforms (at least glibc before version 2.25) have buggy implementations that can easily
//! lead to undefined behaviour in safe Rust code when not properly guarded against.
//! * On some platforms (e.g. macOS), the lock is very slow.
//!
//! Therefore, we implement our own [`RwLock`]! Naively, one might reach for a spinlock, but those
//! can be quite [problematic] when the lock is contended.
//!
//! Instead, this [`RwLock`] copies its implementation strategy from the Windows [SRWLOCK] and the
//! [usync] library implementations.
//!
//! Spinning is still used for the fast path, but it is bounded: after spinning fails, threads will
//! locklessly add an information structure ([`Node`]) containing a [`Thread`] handle into a queue
//! of waiters associated with the lock. The lock owner, upon releasing the lock, will scan through
//! the queue and wake up threads as appropriate, and the newly-awoken threads will then try to
//! acquire the lock themselves.
//!
//! The resulting [`RwLock`] is:
//!
//! * adaptive, since it spins before doing any heavyweight parking operations
//! * allocation-free, modulo the per-thread [`Thread`] handle, which is allocated anyways when
//! using threads created by `std`
//! * writer-preferring, even if some readers may still slip through
//! * unfair, which reduces context-switching and thus drastically improves performance
//!
//! and also quite fast in most cases.

//! ## State
//!
//! A single [`AtomicPtr`] is used as state variable. The lowest four bits are used to indicate the
//! meaning of the remaining bits:
//!
//! | [`LOCKED`] | [`QUEUED`] | [`QUEUE_LOCKED`] | [`DOWNGRADED`] | Remaining    |                                                                                                                             |
//! |------------|:-----------|:-----------------|:---------------|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 0          | 0          | 0                | 0              | 0            | The lock is unlocked, no threads are waiting                                                                                |
//! | 1          | 0          | 0                | 0              | 0            | The lock is write-locked, no threads waiting                                                                                |
//! | 1          | 0          | 0                | 0              | n > 0        | The lock is read-locked with n readers                                                                                      |
//! | 0          | 1          | *                | 0              | `*mut Node`  | The lock is unlocked, but some threads are waiting. Only writers may lock the lock                                          |
//! | 1          | 1          | *                | *              | `*mut Node`  | The lock is locked, but some threads are waiting. If the lock is read-locked, the last queue node contains the reader count |
//!
//! ## Waiter Queue
//!
//! When threads are waiting on the lock (the `QUEUE` bit is set), the lock state points to a queue
//! of waiters, which is implemented as a linked list of nodes stored on the stack to avoid memory
//! allocation.
//!
//! To enable lock-free enqueuing of new nodes to the queue, the linked list is singly-linked upon
//! creation.
//!
//! When the lock is read-locked, the lock count (number of readers) is stored in the last link of
//! the queue. Threads have to traverse the queue to find the last element upon releasing the lock.
//! To avoid having to traverse the entire list every time we want to access the reader count, a
//! pointer to the found tail is cached in the (current) first element of the queue.
//!
//! Also, while the lock is unfair for performance reasons, it is still best to wake the tail node
//! first (FIFO ordering). Since we always pop nodes off the tail of the queue, we must store
//! backlinks to previous nodes so that we can update the `tail` field of the (current) first
//! element of the queue. Adding backlinks is done at the same time as finding the tail (via the
//! function [`find_tail_and_add_backlinks`]), and thus encountering a set tail field on a node
//! indicates that all following nodes in the queue are initialized.
//!
//! TLDR: Here's a diagram of what the queue looks like:
//!
//! ```text
//! state
//!   │
//!   ▼
//! ╭───────╮ next ╭───────╮ next ╭───────╮ next ╭───────╮
//! │       ├─────►│       ├─────►│       ├─────►│ count │
//! │       │      │       │      │       │      │       │
//! │       │      │       │◄─────┤       │◄─────┤       │
//! ╰───────╯      ╰───────╯ prev ╰───────╯ prev ╰───────╯
//!                      │                           ▲
//!                      └───────────────────────────┘
//!                                  tail
//! ```
//!
//! Invariants:
//! 1. At least one node must contain a non-null, current `tail` field.
//! 2. The first non-null `tail` field must be valid and current.
//! 3. All nodes preceding this node must have a correct, non-null `next` field.
//! 4. All nodes following this node must have a correct, non-null `prev` field.
//!
//! Access to the queue is controlled by the `QUEUE_LOCKED` bit. Threads will try to set this bit
//! in two cases: one is when a thread enqueues itself and eagerly adds backlinks to the queue
//! (which drastically improves performance), and the other is after a thread unlocks the lock to
//! wake up the next waiter(s).
//!
//! `QUEUE_LOCKED` is set atomically at the same time as the enqueuing/unlocking operations. The
//! thread releasing the `QUEUE_LOCKED` bit will check the state of the lock (in particular, whether
//! a downgrade was requested using the [`DOWNGRADED`] bit) and wake up waiters as appropriate. This
//! guarantees forward progress even if the unlocking thread could not acquire the queue lock.
//!
//! ## Memory Orderings
//!
//! To properly synchronize changes to the data protected by the lock, the lock is acquired and
//! released with [`Acquire`] and [`Release`] ordering, respectively. To propagate the
//! initialization of nodes, changes to the queue lock are also performed using these orderings.
