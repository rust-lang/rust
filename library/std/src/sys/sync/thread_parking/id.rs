//! Thread parking using thread ids.
//!
//! Some platforms (notably NetBSD) have thread parking primitives whose semantics
//! match those offered by `thread::park`, with the difference that the thread to
//! be unparked is referenced by a platform-specific thread id. Since the thread
//! parker is constructed before that id is known, an atomic state variable is used
//! to manage the park state and propagate the thread id. This also avoids platform
//! calls in the case where `unpark` is called before `park`.
