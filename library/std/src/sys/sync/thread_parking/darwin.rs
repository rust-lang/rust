//! Thread parking for Darwin-based systems.
//!
//! Darwin actually has futex syscalls (`__ulock_wait`/`__ulock_wake`), but they
//! cannot be used in `std` because they are non-public (their use will lead to
//! rejection from the App Store).
//!
//! Therefore, we need to look for other synchronization primitives. Luckily, Darwin
//! supports semaphores, which allow us to implement the behavior we need with
//! only one primitive (as opposed to a mutex-condvar pair). We use the semaphore
//! provided by libdispatch, as the underlying Mach semaphore is only dubiously
//! public.
