//! Thread Local Storage
//!
//! Currently, we are limited to 1023 TLS entries. The entries
//! live in a page of memory that's unique per-process, and is
//! stored in the `$tp` register. If this register is 0, then
//! TLS has not been initialized and thread cleanup can be skipped.
//!
//! The index into this register is the `key`. This key is identical
//! between all threads, but indexes a different offset within this
//! pointer.
//!
//! # Dtor registration (stolen from Windows)
//!
//! Xous has no native support for running destructors so we manage our own
//! list of destructors to keep track of how to destroy keys. When a thread
//! or the process exits, `run_dtors` is called, which will iterate through
//! the list and run the destructors.
//!
//! Currently unregistration from this list is not supported. A destructor can be
//! registered but cannot be unregistered. There's various simplifying reasons
//! for doing this, the big ones being:
//!
//! 1. Currently we don't even support deallocating TLS keys, so normal operation
//!    doesn't need to deallocate a destructor.
//! 2. There is no point in time where we know we can unregister a destructor
//!    because it could always be getting run by some remote thread.
//!
//! Typically processes have a statically known set of TLS keys which is pretty
//! small, and we'd want to keep this memory alive for the whole process anyway
//! really.
//!
//! Perhaps one day we can fold the `Box` here into a static allocation,
//! expanding the `LazyKey` structure to contain not only a slot for the TLS
//! key but also a slot for the destructor queue on windows. An optimization for
//! another day!

// FIXME(joboet): implement support for native TLS instead.
