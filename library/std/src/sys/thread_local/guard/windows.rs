//! Support for Windows TLS destructors.
//!
//! Unfortunately, Windows does not provide a nice API to provide a destructor
//! for a TLS variable. Thus, the solution here ended up being a little more
//! obscure, but fear not, the internet has informed me [1][2] that this solution
//! is not unique (no way I could have thought of it as well!). The key idea is
//! to insert some hook somewhere to run arbitrary code on thread termination.
//! With this in place we'll be able to run anything we like, including all
//! TLS destructors!
//!
//! In order to realize this, all TLS destructors are tracked by *us*, not the
//! Windows runtime. This means that we have a global list of destructors for
//! each TLS key or variable that we know about.
//!
//! # What's up with CRT$XLB?
//!
//! For anything about TLS destructors to work on Windows, we have to be able
//! to run *something* when a thread exits. To do so, we place a very special
//! static in a very special location. If this is encoded in just the right
//! way, the kernel's loader is apparently nice enough to run some function
//! of ours whenever a thread exits! How nice of the kernel!
//!
//! Lots of detailed information can be found in source [1] above, but the
//! gist of it is that this is leveraging a feature of Microsoft's PE format
//! (executable format) which is not actually used by any compilers today.
//! This apparently translates to any callbacks in the ".CRT$XLB" section
//! being run on certain events.
//!
//! So after all that, we use the compiler's `#[link_section]` feature to place
//! a callback pointer into the magic section so it ends up being called.
//!
//! # What's up with this callback?
//!
//! The callback specified receives a number of parameters from... someone!
//! (the kernel? the runtime? I'm not quite sure!) There are a few events that
//! this gets invoked for, but we're currently only interested on when a
//! thread or a process "detaches" (exits). The process part happens for the
//! last thread and the thread part happens for any normal thread.
//!
//! # The article mentions weird stuff about "/INCLUDE"?
//!
//! It sure does! Specifically we're talking about this quote:
//!
//! ```quote
//! The Microsoft run-time library facilitates this process by defining a
//! memory image of the TLS Directory and giving it the special name
//! “__tls_used” (Intel x86 platforms) or “_tls_used” (other platforms). The
//! linker looks for this memory image and uses the data there to create the
//! TLS Directory. Other compilers that support TLS and work with the
//! Microsoft linker must use this same technique.
//! ```
//!
//! Basically what this means is that if we want support for our TLS
//! destructors/our hook being called then we need to make sure the linker does
//! not omit this symbol. Otherwise it will omit it and our callback won't be
//! wired up.
//!
//! We don't actually use the `/INCLUDE` linker flag here like the article
//! mentions because the Rust compiler doesn't propagate linker flags, but
//! instead we use a shim function which performs a volatile 1-byte load from
//! the address of the symbol to ensure it sticks around.
