///   created when copying from/to userspace. Destructors will not be called.
/// * **No references or Rust-style owned pointers** (`Vec`, `Arc`, etc.). When
///   reading from userspace, references into enclave memory must not be
///   created. Also, only enclave memory is considered managed by the Rust
///   compiler's static analysis. When reading from userspace, there can be no
///   guarantee that the value correctly adheres to the expectations of the
///   type. When writing to userspace, memory addresses of data in enclave
///   memory must not be leaked for confidentiality reasons. `User` and
///   `UserRef` are also not allowed for the same reasons.
/// * **No fat pointers.** When reading from userspace, the size or vtable
///   pointer could be automatically interpreted and used by the code. When
///   writing to userspace, memory addresses of data in enclave memory (such
///   as vtable pointers) must not be leaked for confidentiality reasons.
///
/// Non-exhaustive list of specific requirements for reading from userspace:
/// * **Any bit pattern is valid** for this type (no `enum`s). There can be no
