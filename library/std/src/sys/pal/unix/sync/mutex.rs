        // try to re-lock it from the same thread when you already hold a lock
        // (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_mutex_init.html).

        // (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33770#issuecomment-220847521) -- in that
        // case, `pthread_mutexattr_settype(PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT)` will of course be the same
        // as setting it to `PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL`, but not setting any mode will result in
        // a Mutex where re-locking is UB.
        //
        // In practice, glibc takes advantage of this undefined behavior to
        // implement hardware lock elision, which uses hardware transactional
        // memory to avoid acquiring the lock. While a transaction is in
        // progress, the lock appears to be unlocked. This isn't a problem for
        // other threads since the transactional memory will abort if a conflict
        // is detected, however no abort is generated when re-locking from the
        // same thread.
        //
        // Since locking the same mutex twice will result in two aliasing &mut
        // references, we instead create the mutex with type
        // PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL which is guaranteed to deadlock if we try to
        // re-lock it from the same thread, thus avoiding undefined behavior.
