//! System bindings for the wasm/web platform
//!
//! This module contains the facade (aka platform-specific) implementations of
//! OS level functionality for wasm. Note that this wasm is *not* the emscripten
//! or wasi wasm, so we have no runtime here.
//!
//! This is all super highly experimental and not actually intended for
//! wide/production use yet, it's still all in the experimental category. This
//! will likely change over time.
//!
//! Currently all functions here are basically stubs that immediately return
//! errors. The hope is that with a portability lint we can turn actually just
//! remove all this and just omit parts of the standard library if we're
//! compiling for wasm. That way it's a compile time error for something that's
//! guaranteed to be a runtime error!
