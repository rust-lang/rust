//! This module contains a canonical definition of the `cabi_realloc` function
//! for the component model.
//!
//! The component model's canonical ABI for representing datatypes in memory
//! makes use of this function when transferring lists and strings, for example.
//! This function behaves like C's `realloc` but also takes alignment into
//! account.
//!
//! Components are notably not required to export this function, but nearly
//! all components end up doing so currently. This definition in the standard
//! library removes the need for all compilations to define this themselves.
//!
//! More information about the canonical ABI can be found at
//! <https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/CanonicalABI.md>
//!
//! Note that the name of this function is not standardized in the canonical ABI
//! at this time. Instead it's a convention of the "componentization process"
//! where a core wasm module is converted to a component to use this name.
//! Additionally this is not the only possible definition of this function, so
//! this is defined as a "weak" symbol. This means that other definitions are
//! allowed to overwrite it if they are present in a compilation.
