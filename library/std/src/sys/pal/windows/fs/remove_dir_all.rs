//! The Windows implementation of std::fs::remove_dir_all.
//!
//! This needs to address two issues:
//!
//! - It must not be possible to trick this into deleting files outside of
//!   the parent directory (see CVE-2022-21658).
//! - It should not fail if many threads or processes call `remove_dir_all`
//!   on the same path.
//!
//! The first is handled by using the low-level `NtOpenFile` API to open a file
//! relative to a parent directory.
//!
//! The second is trickier. Deleting a file works by setting its "disposition"
//! to delete. However, it isn't actually deleted until the file is closed.
//! During the gap between these two events, the file is in a kind of limbo
//! state where it still exists in the filesystem but anything trying to open
//! it fails with an error.
//!
//! The mitigations we use here are:
//!
//! - When attempting to open the file, we treat ERROR_DELETE_PENDING as a
//!   successful delete.
//! - If the file still hasn't been removed from the filesystem by the time we
//!   attempt to delete the parent directory, we try to wait for it to finish.
//!   We can't wait indefinitely though so after some number of spins, we give
//!   up and return an error.
//!
//! In short, we can't guarantee this will always succeed in the event of a
//! race but we do make a best effort such that it *should* do so.
