The `windows_sys.rs` file is autogenerated from `bindings.txt` and must not
be edited manually.

To add bindings, edit `bindings.txt` then regenerate using the following command:

    ./x run generate-windows-sys && ./x fmt

If you need to override generated functions or types then add them to
`library/std/src/sys/pal/windows/c.rs`.
