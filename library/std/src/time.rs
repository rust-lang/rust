/// Instants are always guaranteed, barring [platform bugs], to be no less than any previously
/// measured instant when created, and are often useful for tasks such as measuring
/// benchmarks or timing how long an operation takes.
///
/// Note, however, that instants are **not** guaranteed to be **steady**. In other
/// words, each tick of the underlying clock might not be the same length (e.g.
/// some seconds may be longer than others). An instant may jump forwards or
/// experience time dilation (slow down or speed up), but it will never go
/// backwards.
/// As part of this non-guarantee it is also not specified whether system suspends count as
/// elapsed time or not. The behavior varies across platforms and Rust versions.
///
/// Instants are opaque types that can only be compared to one another. There is
/// no method to get "the number of seconds" from an instant. Instead, it only
/// allows measuring the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).
///
/// The size of an `Instant` struct may vary depending on the target operating
/// system.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
/// use std::thread::sleep;
///
/// fn main() {
///    let now = Instant::now();
///
///    // we sleep for 2 seconds
///    sleep(Duration::new(2, 0));
///    // it prints '2'
///    println!("{}", now.elapsed().as_secs());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [platform bugs]: Instant#monotonicity
///
/// # OS-specific behaviors
///
/// An `Instant` is a wrapper around system-specific types and it may behave
/// differently depending on the underlying operating system. For example,

///
/// ```no_run
