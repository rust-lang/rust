/// # Usage
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(thread_spawn_hook)]
///
/// std::thread::add_spawn_hook(|_| {
///     ..; // This will run in the parent (spawning) thread.
///     move || {
///         ..; // This will run it the child (spawned) thread.
///     }
/// });
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// A spawn hook can be used to "inherit" a thread local from the parent thread:
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(thread_spawn_hook)]
///
/// use std::cell::Cell;
///
/// thread_local! {
///     static X: Cell<u32> = Cell::new(0);
/// }
///
/// // This needs to be done once in the main thread before spawning any threads.
/// std::thread::add_spawn_hook(|_| {
///     // Get the value of X in the spawning thread.
///     let value = X.get();
///     // Set the value of X in the newly spawned thread.
///     move || X.set(value)
/// });
///
/// X.set(123);
///
/// std::thread::spawn(|| {
///     assert_eq!(X.get(), 123);
/// }).join().unwrap();
/// ```
