/// and also the time during which they might still be running.
/// Once this lifetime ends, all scoped threads are joined.
/// This lifetime starts within the `scope` function, before `f` (the argument to `scope`) starts.
/// It ends after `f` returns and all scoped threads have been joined, but before `scope` returns.
///
/// The `'env` lifetime represents the lifetime of whatever is borrowed by the scoped threads.
/// This lifetime must outlast the call to `scope`, and thus cannot be smaller than `'scope`.
/// It can be as small as the call to `scope`, meaning that anything that outlives this call,
/// such as local variables defined right before the scope, can be borrowed by the scoped threads.
///
/// The `'env: 'scope` bound is part of the definition of the `Scope` type.
