#[doc(keyword = "as")]
//
/// Cast between types, or rename an import.
///
/// `as` is most commonly used to turn primitive types into other primitive types, but it has other
/// uses that include turning pointers into addresses, addresses into pointers, and pointers into
/// other pointers.
///
/// ```rust
/// let thing1: u8 = 89.0 as u8;
/// assert_eq!('B' as u32, 66);
/// assert_eq!(thing1 as char, 'Y');
/// let thing2: f32 = thing1 as f32 + 10.5;
/// assert_eq!(true as u8 + thing2 as u8, 100);
/// ```
///
/// In general, any cast that can be performed via ascribing the type can also be done using `as`,
/// so instead of writing `let x: u32 = 123`, you can write `let x = 123 as u32` (note: `let x: u32
/// = 123` would be best in that situation). The same is not true in the other direction, however;
/// explicitly using `as` allows a few more coercions that aren't allowed implicitly, such as
/// changing the type of a raw pointer or turning closures into raw pointers.
///
/// `as` can be seen as the primitive for `From` and `Into`: `as` only works  with primitives
/// (`u8`, `bool`, `str`, pointers, ...) whereas `From` and `Into`  also works with types like
/// `String` or `Vec`.
///
/// `as` can also be used with the `_` placeholder when the destination type can be inferred. Note
/// that this can cause inference breakage and usually such code should use an explicit type for
/// both clarity and stability. This is most useful when converting pointers using `as *const _` or
/// `as *mut _` though the [`cast`][const-cast] method is recommended over `as *const _` and it is
/// [the same][mut-cast] for `as *mut _`: those methods make the intent clearer.
///
/// `as` is also used to rename imports in [`use`] and [`extern crate`][`crate`] statements:
///
/// ```
/// # #[allow(unused_imports)]
/// use std::{mem as memory, net as network};
/// // Now you can use the names `memory` and `network` to refer to `std::mem` and `std::net`.

/// Compile-time constants, compile-time evaluable functions, and raw pointers.

/// ## Compile-time constants
///
/// Sometimes a certain value is used many times throughout a program, and it can become
/// inconvenient to copy it over and over. What's more, it's not always possible or desirable to
/// make it a variable that gets carried around to each function that needs it. In these cases, the
/// `const` keyword provides a convenient alternative to code duplication:
///
/// ```rust
/// const THING: u32 = 0xABAD1DEA;
///
/// let foo = 123 + THING;
/// ```
///
/// Constants must be explicitly typed; unlike with `let`, you can't ignore their type and let the
/// compiler figure it out. Any constant value can be defined in a `const`, which in practice happens
/// to be most things that would be reasonable to have in a constant (barring `const fn`s). For
/// example, you can't have a [`File`] as a `const`.
///
/// [`File`]: crate::fs::File
///
/// The only lifetime allowed in a constant is `'static`, which is the lifetime that encompasses
/// all others in a Rust program. For example, if you wanted to define a constant string, it would
/// look like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// const WORDS: &'static str = "hello rust!";
/// ```
///
/// Thanks to static lifetime elision, you usually don't have to explicitly use `'static`:
///
/// ```rust
/// const WORDS: &str = "hello convenience!";
/// ```
///
/// `const` items look remarkably similar to `static` items, which introduces some confusion as
/// to which one should be used at which times. To put it simply, constants are inlined wherever
/// they're used, making using them identical to simply replacing the name of the `const` with its
/// value. Static variables, on the other hand, point to a single location in memory, which all
/// accesses share. This means that, unlike with constants, they can't have destructors, and act as
/// a single value across the entire codebase.
///
/// Constants, like statics, should always be in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
///
/// For more detail on `const`, see the [Rust Book] or the [Reference].
///
/// ## Compile-time evaluable functions
///
/// The other main use of the `const` keyword is in `const fn`. This marks a function as being
/// callable in the body of a `const` or `static` item and in array initializers (commonly called
/// "const contexts"). `const fn` are restricted in the set of operations they can perform, to
/// ensure that they can be evaluated at compile-time. See the [Reference][const-eval] for more
/// detail.
///
/// Turning a `fn` into a `const fn` has no effect on run-time uses of that function.
///
/// ## Other uses of `const`

/// The `const` keyword is also used in raw pointers in combination with `mut`, as seen in `*const
/// T` and `*mut T`. More about `const` as used in raw pointers can be read at the Rust docs for the [pointer primitive].

#[doc(keyword = "struct")]
//
/// A type that is composed of other types.
///
/// Structs in Rust come in three flavors: Structs with named fields, tuple structs, and unit
/// structs.
///
/// ```rust
/// struct Regular {
///     field1: f32,
///     field2: String,
///     pub field3: bool
/// }
///
/// struct Tuple(u32, String);
///
/// struct Unit;
/// ```
///
/// Regular structs are the most commonly used. Each field defined within them has a name and a
/// type, and once defined can be accessed using `example_struct.field` syntax. The fields of a
/// struct share its mutability, so `foo.bar = 2;` would only be valid if `foo` was mutable. Adding
/// `pub` to a field makes it visible to code in other modules, as well as allowing it to be
/// directly accessed and modified.
///
/// Tuple structs are similar to regular structs, but its fields have no names. They are used like
/// tuples, with deconstruction possible via `let TupleStruct(x, y) = foo;` syntax. For accessing
/// individual variables, the same syntax is used as with regular tuples, namely `foo.0`, `foo.1`,
/// etc, starting at zero.
///
/// Unit structs are most commonly used as marker. They have a size of zero bytes, but unlike empty
/// enums they can be instantiated, making them isomorphic to the unit type `()`. Unit structs are
/// useful when you need to implement a trait on something, but don't need to store any data inside
/// it.
///
/// # Instantiation
///
/// Structs can be instantiated in different ways, all of which can be mixed and
/// matched as needed. The most common way to make a new struct is via a constructor method such as
/// `new()`, but when that isn't available (or you're writing the constructor itself), struct
/// literal syntax is used:
///
/// ```rust
/// # struct Foo { field1: f32, field2: String, etc: bool }
/// let example = Foo {
///     field1: 42.0,
///     field2: "blah".to_string(),
///     etc: true,
/// };
/// ```
///
/// It's only possible to directly instantiate a struct using struct literal syntax when all of its
/// fields are visible to you.
///
/// There are a handful of shortcuts provided to make writing constructors more convenient, most
/// common of which is the Field Init shorthand. When there is a variable and a field of the same
/// name, the assignment can be simplified from `field: field` into simply `field`. The following
/// example of a hypothetical constructor demonstrates this:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct User {
///     name: String,
///     admin: bool,
/// }
///
/// impl User {
///     pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
///         Self {
///             name,
///             admin: false,
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Another shortcut for struct instantiation is available, used when you need to make a new
/// struct that has the same values as most of a previous struct of the same type, called struct
/// update syntax:
///
/// ```rust
/// # struct Foo { field1: String, field2: () }
/// # let thing = Foo { field1: "".to_string(), field2: () };
/// let updated_thing = Foo {
///     field1: "a new value".to_string(),
///     ..thing
/// };
/// ```
///
/// Tuple structs are instantiated in the same way as tuples themselves, except with the struct's
/// name as a prefix: `Foo(123, false, 0.1)`.
///
/// Empty structs are instantiated with just their name, and don't need anything else. `let thing =
/// EmptyStruct;`
///
/// # Style conventions
///
/// Structs are always written in UpperCamelCase, with few exceptions. While the trailing comma on a
/// struct's list of fields can be omitted, it's usually kept for convenience in adding and
/// removing fields down the line.
///
/// For more information on structs, take a look at the [Rust Book][book] or the
/// [Reference][reference].

//
/// A common interface for a group of types.
///
/// A `trait` is like an interface that data types can implement. When a type
/// implements a trait it can be treated abstractly as that trait using generics
/// or trait objects.
///
/// Traits can be made up of three varieties of associated items:
///
/// - functions and methods
/// - types
/// - constants
///
/// Traits may also contain additional type parameters. Those type parameters
/// or the trait itself can be constrained by other traits.
///
/// Traits can serve as markers or carry other logical semantics that
/// aren't expressed through their items. When a type implements that
/// trait it is promising to uphold its contract. [`Send`] and [`Sync`] are two
/// such marker traits present in the standard library.
///
/// See the [Reference][Ref-Traits] for a lot more information on traits.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Traits are declared using the `trait` keyword. Types can implement them
/// using [`impl`] `Trait` [`for`] `Type`:
///
/// ```rust
/// trait Zero {
///     const ZERO: Self;
///     fn is_zero(&self) -> bool;
/// }
///
/// impl Zero for i32 {
///     const ZERO: Self = 0;
///
///     fn is_zero(&self) -> bool {
///         *self == Self::ZERO
///     }
/// }
///
/// assert_eq!(i32::ZERO, 0);
/// assert!(i32::ZERO.is_zero());
/// assert!(!4.is_zero());
/// ```
///
/// With an associated type:
///
/// ```rust
/// trait Builder {
///     type Built;
///
///     fn build(&self) -> Self::Built;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Traits can be generic, with constraints or without:
///
/// ```rust
/// trait MaybeFrom<T> {
///     fn maybe_from(value: T) -> Option<Self>
///     where
///         Self: Sized;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Traits can build upon the requirements of other traits. In the example
/// below `Iterator` is a **supertrait** and `ThreeIterator` is a **subtrait**:
///
/// ```rust
/// trait ThreeIterator: Iterator {
///     fn next_three(&mut self) -> Option<[Self::Item; 3]>;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Traits can be used in functions, as parameters:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// fn debug_iter<I: Iterator>(it: I) where I::Item: std::fmt::Debug {
///     for elem in it {
///         println!("{elem:#?}");
///     }
/// }
///
/// // u8_len_1, u8_len_2 and u8_len_3 are equivalent
///
/// fn u8_len_1(val: impl Into<Vec<u8>>) -> usize {
///     val.into().len()
/// }
///
/// fn u8_len_2<T: Into<Vec<u8>>>(val: T) -> usize {
///     val.into().len()
/// }
///
/// fn u8_len_3<T>(val: T) -> usize
/// where
///     T: Into<Vec<u8>>,
/// {
///     val.into().len()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Or as return types:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// fn from_zero_to(v: u8) -> impl Iterator<Item = u8> {
///     (0..v).into_iter()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The use of the [`impl`] keyword in this position allows the function writer
/// to hide the concrete type as an implementation detail which can change
/// without breaking user's code.
///
/// # Trait objects
///
/// A *trait object* is an opaque value of another type that implements a set of
/// traits. A trait object implements all specified traits as well as their
/// supertraits (if any).
///
/// The syntax is the following: `dyn BaseTrait + AutoTrait1 + ... AutoTraitN`.
/// Only one `BaseTrait` can be used so this will not compile:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail,E0225
/// trait A {}
/// trait B {}
///
/// let _: Box<dyn A + B>;
/// ```
///
/// Neither will this, which is a syntax error:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// trait A {}
/// trait B {}
///
/// let _: Box<dyn A + dyn B>;
/// ```
///
/// On the other hand, this is correct:
///
/// ```rust
/// trait A {}
///
/// let _: Box<dyn A + Send + Sync>;
/// ```
///
/// The [Reference][Ref-Trait-Objects] has more information about trait objects,
/// their limitations and the differences between editions.
///
/// # Unsafe traits
///
/// Some traits may be unsafe to implement. Using the [`unsafe`] keyword in
/// front of the trait's declaration is used to mark this:

#[doc(keyword = "unsafe")]
//
/// Code or interfaces whose [memory safety] cannot be verified by the type
/// system.
///
/// The `unsafe` keyword has two uses:
/// - to declare the existence of contracts the compiler can't check (`unsafe fn` and `unsafe
/// trait`),
/// - and to declare that a programmer has checked that these contracts have been upheld (`unsafe
/// {}` and `unsafe impl`, but also `unsafe fn` -- see below).
///
/// They are not mutually exclusive, as can be seen in `unsafe fn`: the body of an `unsafe fn` is,
/// by default, treated like an unsafe block. The `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` lint can be enabled to
/// change that.
///
/// # Unsafe abilities
///
/// **No matter what, Safe Rust can't cause Undefined Behavior**. This is
/// referred to as [soundness]: a well-typed program actually has the desired
/// properties. The [Nomicon][nomicon-soundness] has a more detailed explanation
/// on the subject.
///
/// To ensure soundness, Safe Rust is restricted enough that it can be
/// automatically checked. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to write code
/// that is correct for reasons which are too clever for the compiler to
/// understand. In those cases, you need to use Unsafe Rust.
///
/// Here are the abilities Unsafe Rust has in addition to Safe Rust:
///
/// - Dereference [raw pointers]
/// - Implement `unsafe` [`trait`]s
/// - Call `unsafe` functions
/// - Mutate [`static`]s (including [`extern`]al ones)
/// - Access fields of [`union`]s
///
/// However, this extra power comes with extra responsibilities: it is now up to
/// you to ensure soundness. The `unsafe` keyword helps by clearly marking the
/// pieces of code that need to worry about this.
///
/// ## The different meanings of `unsafe`
///
/// Not all uses of `unsafe` are equivalent: some are here to mark the existence
/// of a contract the programmer must check, others are to say "I have checked
/// the contract, go ahead and do this". The following
/// [discussion on Rust Internals] has more in-depth explanations about this but
/// here is a summary of the main points:
///
/// - `unsafe fn`: calling this function means abiding by a contract the
/// compiler cannot enforce.
/// - `unsafe trait`: implementing the [`trait`] means abiding by a
/// contract the compiler cannot enforce.
/// - `unsafe {}`: the contract necessary to call the operations inside the
/// block has been checked by the programmer and is guaranteed to be respected.
/// - `unsafe impl`: the contract necessary to implement the trait has been
/// checked by the programmer and is guaranteed to be respected.
///
/// By default, `unsafe fn` also acts like an `unsafe {}` block
/// around the code inside the function. This means it is not just a signal to
/// the caller, but also promises that the preconditions for the operations
/// inside the function are upheld. Mixing these two meanings can be confusing, so the
/// `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` lint can be enabled to warn against that and require explicit unsafe
/// blocks even inside `unsafe fn`.
///
/// See the [Rustonomicon] and the [Reference] for more information.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Marking elements as `unsafe`
///
/// `unsafe` can be used on functions. Note that functions and statics declared
/// in [`extern`] blocks are implicitly marked as `unsafe` (but not functions
/// declared as `extern "something" fn ...`). Mutable statics are always unsafe,
/// wherever they are declared. Methods can also be declared as `unsafe`:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// static mut FOO: &str = "hello";
///
/// unsafe fn unsafe_fn() {}
///
/// extern "C" {
///     fn unsafe_extern_fn();
///     static BAR: *mut u32;
/// }
///
/// trait SafeTraitWithUnsafeMethod {
///     unsafe fn unsafe_method(&self);
/// }
///
/// struct S;
///
/// impl S {
///     unsafe fn unsafe_method_on_struct() {}
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Traits can also be declared as `unsafe`:
///
/// ```rust
/// unsafe trait UnsafeTrait {}
/// ```
///
/// Since `unsafe fn` and `unsafe trait` indicate that there is a safety
/// contract that the compiler cannot enforce, documenting it is important. The
/// standard library has many examples of this, like the following which is an
/// extract from [`Vec::set_len`]. The `# Safety` section explains the contract
/// that must be fulfilled to safely call the function.
///
/// ```rust,ignore (stub-to-show-doc-example)
/// /// Forces the length of the vector to `new_len`.
/// ///
/// /// This is a low-level operation that maintains none of the normal
/// /// invariants of the type. Normally changing the length of a vector
/// /// is done using one of the safe operations instead, such as
/// /// `truncate`, `resize`, `extend`, or `clear`.
/// ///
/// /// # Safety
/// ///
/// /// - `new_len` must be less than or equal to `capacity()`.
/// /// - The elements at `old_len..new_len` must be initialized.
/// pub unsafe fn set_len(&mut self, new_len: usize)
/// ```
///
/// ## Using `unsafe {}` blocks and `impl`s
///
/// Performing `unsafe` operations requires an `unsafe {}` block:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// #![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
///
/// /// Dereference the given pointer.
/// ///
/// /// # Safety
/// ///
/// /// `ptr` must be aligned and must not be dangling.
/// unsafe fn deref_unchecked(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 {
///     // SAFETY: the caller is required to ensure that `ptr` is aligned and dereferenceable.
///     unsafe { *ptr }
/// }
///
/// let a = 3;
/// let b = &a as *const _;
/// // SAFETY: `a` has not been dropped and references are always aligned,
/// // so `b` is a valid address.
/// unsafe { assert_eq!(*b, deref_unchecked(b)); };
/// ```
///
/// ## `unsafe` and traits
///
/// The interactions of `unsafe` and traits can be surprising, so let us contrast the
/// two combinations of safe `fn` in `unsafe trait` and `unsafe fn` in safe trait using two
/// examples:
///
/// ```rust
/// /// # Safety
/// ///
/// /// `make_even` must return an even number.
/// unsafe trait MakeEven {
///     fn make_even(&self) -> i32;
/// }
///
/// // SAFETY: Our `make_even` always returns something even.
/// unsafe impl MakeEven for i32 {
///     fn make_even(&self) -> i32 {
///         self << 1
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn use_make_even(x: impl MakeEven) {
///     if x.make_even() % 2 == 1 {
///         // SAFETY: this can never happen, because all `MakeEven` implementations
///         // ensure that `make_even` returns something even.
///         unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() };
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note how the safety contract of the trait is upheld by the implementation, and is itself used to
/// uphold the safety contract of the unsafe function `unreachable_unchecked` called by
/// `use_make_even`. `make_even` itself is a safe function because its *callers* do not have to
/// worry about any contract, only the *implementation* of `MakeEven` is required to uphold a
/// certain contract. `use_make_even` is safe because it can use the promise made by `MakeEven`
/// implementations to uphold the safety contract of the `unsafe fn unreachable_unchecked` it calls.
///
/// It is also possible to have `unsafe fn` in a regular safe `trait`:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![feature(never_type)]
/// #![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
///
/// trait Indexable {
///     const LEN: usize;
///
///     /// # Safety
///     ///
///     /// The caller must ensure that `idx < LEN`.
///     unsafe fn idx_unchecked(&self, idx: usize) -> i32;
/// }
///
/// // The implementation for `i32` doesn't need to do any contract reasoning.
/// impl Indexable for i32 {
///     const LEN: usize = 1;
///
///     unsafe fn idx_unchecked(&self, idx: usize) -> i32 {
///         debug_assert_eq!(idx, 0);
///         *self
///     }
/// }
///
/// // The implementation for arrays exploits the function contract to
/// // make use of `get_unchecked` on slices and avoid a run-time check.
/// impl Indexable for [i32; 42] {
///     const LEN: usize = 42;
///
///     unsafe fn idx_unchecked(&self, idx: usize) -> i32 {
///         // SAFETY: As per this trait's documentation, the caller ensures
///         // that `idx < 42`.
///         unsafe { *self.get_unchecked(idx) }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // The implementation for the never type declares a length of 0,
/// // which means `idx_unchecked` can never be called.
/// impl Indexable for ! {
///     const LEN: usize = 0;
///
///     unsafe fn idx_unchecked(&self, idx: usize) -> i32 {
///         // SAFETY: As per this trait's documentation, the caller ensures
///         // that `idx < 0`, which is impossible, so this is dead code.
///         unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn use_indexable<I: Indexable>(x: I, idx: usize) -> i32 {
///     if idx < I::LEN {
///         // SAFETY: We have checked that `idx < I::LEN`.
///         unsafe { x.idx_unchecked(idx) }
///     } else {
///         panic!("index out-of-bounds")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This time, `use_indexable` is safe because it uses a run-time check to discharge the safety
/// contract of `idx_unchecked`. Implementing `Indexable` is safe because when writing
/// `idx_unchecked`, we don't have to worry: our *callers* need to discharge a proof obligation
/// (like `use_indexable` does), but the *implementation* of `get_unchecked` has no proof obligation
/// to contend with. Of course, the implementation of `Indexable` may choose to call other unsafe
/// operations, and then it needs an `unsafe` *block* to indicate it discharged the proof
/// obligations of its callees. (We enabled `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`, so the body of `idx_unchecked`
/// is not implicitly an unsafe block.) For that purpose it can make use of the contract that all
/// its callers must uphold -- the fact that `idx < LEN`.
///
/// Formally speaking, an `unsafe fn` in a trait is a function with *preconditions* that go beyond
/// those encoded by the argument types (such as `idx < LEN`), whereas an `unsafe trait` can declare
/// that some of its functions have *postconditions* that go beyond those encoded in the return type
/// (such as returning an even integer). If a trait needs a function with both extra precondition
/// and extra postcondition, then it needs an `unsafe fn` in an `unsafe trait`.

/// Import or rename items from other crates or modules, or specify precise capturing
/// with `use<..>`.
///
/// ## Importing items
///
/// The `use` keyword is employed to shorten the path required to refer to a module item.
/// The keyword may appear in modules, blocks, and even functions, typically at the top.
///
/// The most basic usage of the keyword is `use path::to::item;`,
/// though a number of convenient shortcuts are supported:
///
///   * Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix,
///     using the glob-like brace syntax `use a::b::{c, d, e::f, g::h::i};`
///   * Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix and their common parent module,
///     using the [`self`] keyword, such as `use a::b::{self, c, d::e};`
///   * Rebinding the target name as a new local name, using the syntax `use p::q::r as x;`.
///     This can also be used with the last two features: `use a::b::{self as ab, c as abc}`.
///   * Binding all paths matching a given prefix,
///     using the asterisk wildcard syntax `use a::b::*;`.
///   * Nesting groups of the previous features multiple times,
///     such as `use a::b::{self as ab, c, d::{*, e::f}};`
///   * Reexporting with visibility modifiers such as `pub use a::b;`
///   * Importing with `_` to only import the methods of a trait without binding it to a name
///     (to avoid conflict for example): `use ::std::io::Read as _;`.
///
/// Using path qualifiers like [`crate`], [`super`] or [`self`] is supported: `use crate::a::b;`.
///
/// Note that when the wildcard `*` is used on a type, it does not import its methods (though
/// for `enum`s it imports the variants, as shown in the example below).
///
/// ```compile_fail,edition2018

/// The differences about paths and the `use` keyword between the 2015 and 2018 editions
/// can also be found in the [Reference][ref-use-decls].
///
/// ## Precise capturing
///
/// The `use<..>` syntax is used within certain `impl Trait` bounds to control which generic
/// parameters are captured. This is important for return-position `impl Trait` (RPIT) types,
/// as it affects borrow checking by controlling which generic parameters can be used in the
/// hidden type.
///
/// For example, the following function demonstrates an error without precise capturing in
/// Rust 2021 and earlier editions:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail,edition2021
/// fn f(x: &()) -> impl Sized { x }
/// ```
///
/// By using `use<'_>` for precise capturing, it can be resolved:
///
/// ```rust
/// fn f(x: &()) -> impl Sized + use<'_> { x }
/// ```
///
/// This syntax specifies that the elided lifetime be captured and therefore available for
/// use in the hidden type.
///
/// In Rust 2024, opaque types automatically capture all lifetime parameters in scope.
/// `use<..>` syntax serves as an important way of opting-out of that default.
///
/// For more details about precise capturing, see the [Reference][ref-impl-trait].

#[doc(keyword = "where")]
//
/// Add constraints that must be upheld to use an item.
///
/// `where` allows specifying constraints on lifetime and generic parameters.
/// The [RFC] introducing `where` contains detailed information about the
/// keyword.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// `where` can be used for constraints with traits:
///
/// ```rust
/// fn new<T: Default>() -> T {
///     T::default()
/// }
///
/// fn new_where<T>() -> T
/// where
///     T: Default,
/// {
///     T::default()
/// }
///
/// assert_eq!(0.0, new());
/// assert_eq!(0.0, new_where());
///
/// assert_eq!(0, new());
/// assert_eq!(0, new_where());
/// ```
///
/// `where` can also be used for lifetimes.
///
/// This compiles because `longer` outlives `shorter`, thus the constraint is
/// respected:
///
/// ```rust
/// fn select<'short, 'long>(s1: &'short str, s2: &'long str, second: bool) -> &'short str
/// where
///     'long: 'short,
/// {
///     if second { s2 } else { s1 }
/// }
///
/// let outer = String::from("Long living ref");
/// let longer = &outer;
/// {
///     let inner = String::from("Short living ref");
///     let shorter = &inner;
///
///     assert_eq!(select(shorter, longer, false), shorter);
///     assert_eq!(select(shorter, longer, true), longer);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// On the other hand, this will not compile because the `where 'b: 'a` clause
/// is missing: the `'b` lifetime is not known to live at least as long as `'a`
/// which means this function cannot ensure it always returns a valid reference:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// fn select<'a, 'b>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'b str, second: bool) -> &'a str
/// {
///     if second { s2 } else { s1 }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `where` can also be used to express more complicated constraints that cannot
/// be written with the `<T: Trait>` syntax:
///
/// ```rust
/// fn first_or_default<I>(mut i: I) -> I::Item
/// where
///     I: Iterator,
///     I::Item: Default,
/// {
///     i.next().unwrap_or_else(I::Item::default)
/// }
///
/// assert_eq!(first_or_default([1, 2, 3].into_iter()), 1);
/// assert_eq!(first_or_default(Vec::<i32>::new().into_iter()), 0);
/// ```
///
/// `where` is available anywhere generic and lifetime parameters are available,
/// as can be seen with the [`Cow`](crate::borrow::Cow) type from the standard
/// library:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// pub enum Cow<'a, B>
/// where
///     B: ToOwned + ?Sized,
/// {
///     Borrowed(&'a B),
///     Owned(<B as ToOwned>::Owned),
/// }
/// ```

//
/// `dyn` is a prefix of a [trait object]'s type.
///
/// The `dyn` keyword is used to highlight that calls to methods on the associated `Trait`
/// are [dynamically dispatched]. To use the trait this way, it must be 'dyn-compatible'[^1].
///
/// Unlike generic parameters or `impl Trait`, the compiler does not know the concrete type that
/// is being passed. That is, the type has been [erased].
/// As such, a `dyn Trait` reference contains _two_ pointers.
/// One pointer goes to the data (e.g., an instance of a struct).
/// Another pointer goes to a map of method call names to function pointers
/// (known as a virtual method table or vtable).
///
/// At run-time, when a method needs to be called on the `dyn Trait`, the vtable is consulted to get
/// the function pointer and then that function pointer is called.
///
/// See the Reference for more information on [trait objects][ref-trait-obj]
/// and [object safety][ref-obj-safety].
///
/// ## Trade-offs
///
/// The above indirection is the additional runtime cost of calling a function on a `dyn Trait`.
/// Methods called by dynamic dispatch generally cannot be inlined by the compiler.
///
/// However, `dyn Trait` is likely to produce smaller code than `impl Trait` / generic parameters as
/// the method won't be duplicated for each concrete type.

#[doc(keyword = "union")]
//
/// The [Rust equivalent of a C-style union][union].
///
/// A `union` looks like a [`struct`] in terms of declaration, but all of its
/// fields exist in the same memory, superimposed over one another. For instance,
/// if we wanted some bits in memory that we sometimes interpret as a `u32` and
/// sometimes as an `f32`, we could write:
///
/// ```rust
/// union IntOrFloat {
///     i: u32,
///     f: f32,
/// }
///
/// let mut u = IntOrFloat { f: 1.0 };
/// // Reading the fields of a union is always unsafe
/// assert_eq!(unsafe { u.i }, 1065353216);
/// // Updating through any of the field will modify all of them
/// u.i = 1073741824;
/// assert_eq!(unsafe { u.f }, 2.0);
/// ```
///
/// # Matching on unions
///
/// It is possible to use pattern matching on `union`s. A single field name must
/// be used and it must match the name of one of the `union`'s field.
/// Like reading from a `union`, pattern matching on a `union` requires `unsafe`.
///
/// ```rust
/// union IntOrFloat {
///     i: u32,
///     f: f32,
/// }
///
/// let u = IntOrFloat { f: 1.0 };
///
/// unsafe {
///     match u {
///         IntOrFloat { i: 10 } => println!("Found exactly ten!"),
///         // Matching the field `f` provides an `f32`.
///         IntOrFloat { f } => println!("Found f = {f} !"),
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # References to union fields
///
/// All fields in a `union` are all at the same place in memory which means
/// borrowing one borrows the entire `union`, for the same lifetime:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail,E0502
/// union IntOrFloat {
///     i: u32,
///     f: f32,
/// }
///
/// let mut u = IntOrFloat { f: 1.0 };
///
/// let f = unsafe { &u.f };
/// // This will not compile because the field has already been borrowed, even
/// // if only immutably
/// let i = unsafe { &mut u.i };
///
/// *i = 10;
/// println!("f = {f} and i = {i}");
/// ```
