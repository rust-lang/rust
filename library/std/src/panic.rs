/// returned is the object with which panic was originally invoked.
///
/// Rust functions that are expected to be called from foreign code that does

/// behavior, it is not necessary to use `catch_unwind` explicitly. This
/// function should instead be used when more graceful error-handling is needed.
///
/// It is **not** recommended to use this function for a general try/catch
/// mechanism. The [`Result`] type is more appropriate to use for functions that
/// can fail on a regular basis. Additionally, this function is not guaranteed
/// to catch all panics, see the "Notes" section below.
///
/// The closure provided is required to adhere to the [`UnwindSafe`] trait to
/// ensure that all captured variables are safe to cross this boundary. The
/// purpose of this bound is to encode the concept of [exception safety][rfc] in
/// the type system. Most usage of this function should not need to worry about
/// this bound as programs are naturally unwind safe without `unsafe` code. If
/// it becomes a problem the [`AssertUnwindSafe`] wrapper struct can be used to
/// quickly assert that the usage here is indeed unwind safe.
///
/// [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md
///
/// # Notes
///
/// This function **might not catch all Rust panics**. A Rust panic is not
/// always implemented via unwinding, but can be implemented by aborting the
/// process as well. This function *only* catches unwinding panics, not those
/// that abort the process.
///
/// If a custom panic hook has been set, it will be invoked before the panic is
/// caught, before unwinding.
///
/// Although unwinding into Rust code with a foreign exception (e.g. an
/// exception thrown from C++ code, or a `panic!` in Rust code compiled or
/// linked with a different runtime) via an appropriate ABI (e.g. `"C-unwind"`)
/// is permitted, catching such an exception using this function will have one
/// of two behaviors, and it is unspecified which will occur:
///
/// * The process aborts, after executing all destructors of `f` and the
///   functions it called.
/// * The function returns a `Result::Err` containing an opaque type.
///
/// Finally, be **careful in how you drop the result of this function**. If it
/// is `Err`, it contains the panic payload, and dropping that may in turn
/// panic!
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::panic;
///
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
///     println!("hello!");
/// });
/// assert!(result.is_ok());
///
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
