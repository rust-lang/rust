/// Wraps a writer and buffers its output.
///
/// It can be excessively inefficient to work directly with something that
/// implements [`Write`]. For example, every call to
/// [`write`][`TcpStream::write`] on [`TcpStream`] results in a system call. A
/// `BufWriter<W>` keeps an in-memory buffer of data and writes it to an underlying
/// writer in large, infrequent batches.
///
/// `BufWriter<W>` can improve the speed of programs that make *small* and
/// *repeated* write calls to the same file or network socket. It does not
/// help when writing very large amounts at once, or writing just one or a few
/// times. It also provides no advantage when writing to a destination that is
/// in memory, like a <code>[Vec]\<u8></code>.
///
/// It is critical to call [`flush`] before `BufWriter<W>` is dropped. Though
/// dropping will attempt to flush the contents of the buffer, any errors
/// that happen in the process of dropping will be ignored. Calling [`flush`]
/// ensures that the buffer is empty and thus dropping will not even attempt
/// file operations.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Let's write the numbers one through ten to a [`TcpStream`]:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
/// use std::net::TcpStream;
///
/// let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:34254").unwrap();
///
/// for i in 0..10 {
///     stream.write(&[i+1]).unwrap();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Because we're not buffering, we write each one in turn, incurring the
/// overhead of a system call per byte written. We can fix this with a
/// `BufWriter<W>`:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
/// use std::io::BufWriter;
/// use std::net::TcpStream;
///
/// let mut stream = BufWriter::new(TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:34254").unwrap());
///
/// for i in 0..10 {
///     stream.write(&[i+1]).unwrap();
/// }
/// stream.flush().unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// By wrapping the stream with a `BufWriter<W>`, these ten writes are all grouped
/// together by the buffer and will all be written out in one system call when
/// the `stream` is flushed.
///
// HACK(#78696): can't use `crate` for associated items
