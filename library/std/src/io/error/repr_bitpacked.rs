//! This is a densely packed error representation which is used on targets with
//! 64-bit pointers.
//!
//! (Note that `bitpacked` vs `unpacked` here has no relationship to
//! `#[repr(packed)]`, it just refers to attempting to use any available bits in
//! a more clever manner than `rustc`'s default layout algorithm would).
//!
//! Conceptually, it stores the same data as the "unpacked" equivalent we use on
//! other targets. Specifically, you can imagine it as an optimized version of
//! the following enum (which is roughly equivalent to what's stored by
//! `repr_unpacked::Repr`, e.g. `super::ErrorData<Box<Custom>>`):
//!
//! ```ignore (exposition-only)
//! enum ErrorData {
//!    Os(i32),
//!    Simple(ErrorKind),
//!    SimpleMessage(&'static SimpleMessage),
//!    Custom(Box<Custom>),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! However, it packs this data into a 64bit non-zero value.
//!
//! This optimization not only allows `io::Error` to occupy a single pointer,
//! but improves `io::Result` as well, especially for situations like
//! `io::Result<()>` (which is now 64 bits) or `io::Result<u64>` (which is now
//! 128 bits), which are quite common.
//!
//! # Layout
//! Tagged values are 64 bits, with the 2 least significant bits used for the
//! tag. This means there are 4 "variants":
//!
//! - **Tag 0b00**: The first variant is equivalent to
//!   `ErrorData::SimpleMessage`, and holds a `&'static SimpleMessage` directly.
//!
//!   `SimpleMessage` has an alignment >= 4 (which is requested with
//!   `#[repr(align)]` and checked statically at the bottom of this file), which
//!   means every `&'static SimpleMessage` should have the both tag bits as 0,
//!   meaning its tagged and untagged representation are equivalent.
//!
//!   This means we can skip tagging it, which is necessary as this variant can
//!   be constructed from a `const fn`, which probably cannot tag pointers (or
//!   at least it would be difficult).
//!
//! - **Tag 0b01**: The other pointer variant holds the data for
//!   `ErrorData::Custom` and the remaining 62 bits are used to store a
//!   `Box<Custom>`. `Custom` also has alignment >= 4, so the bottom two bits
//!   are free to use for the tag.
//!
//!   The only important thing to note is that `ptr::wrapping_add` and
//!   `ptr::wrapping_sub` are used to tag the pointer, rather than bitwise
//!   operations. This should preserve the pointer's provenance, which would
//!   otherwise be lost.
//!
//! - **Tag 0b10**: Holds the data for `ErrorData::Os(i32)`. We store the `i32`
//!   in the pointer's most significant 32 bits, and don't use the bits `2..32`
//!   for anything. Using the top 32 bits is just to let us easily recover the
//!   `i32` code with the correct sign.
//!
//! - **Tag 0b11**: Holds the data for `ErrorData::Simple(ErrorKind)`. This
//!   stores the `ErrorKind` in the top 32 bits as well, although it doesn't
//!   occupy nearly that many. Most of the bits are unused here, but it's not
//!   like we need them for anything else yet.
//!
//! # Use of `NonNull<()>`
//!
//! Everything is stored in a `NonNull<()>`, which is odd, but actually serves a
//! purpose.
//!
//! Conceptually you might think of this more like:
//!
//! ```ignore (exposition-only)
//! union Repr {
//!     // holds integer (Simple/Os) variants, and
//!     // provides access to the tag bits.
//!     bits: NonZero<u64>,
//!     // Tag is 0, so this is stored untagged.
//!     msg: &'static SimpleMessage,
//!     // Tagged (offset) `Box<Custom>` pointer.
//!     tagged_custom: NonNull<()>,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! But there are a few problems with this:
//!
//! 1. Union access is equivalent to a transmute, so this representation would
//!    require we transmute between integers and pointers in at least one
//!    direction, which may be UB (and even if not, it is likely harder for a
//!    compiler to reason about than explicit ptr->int operations).
//!
//! 2. Even if all fields of a union have a niche, the union itself doesn't,
//!    although this may change in the future. This would make things like
//!    `io::Result<()>` and `io::Result<usize>` larger, which defeats part of
//!    the motivation of this bitpacking.
//!
//! Storing everything in a `NonZero<usize>` (or some other integer) would be a
//! bit more traditional for pointer tagging, but it would lose provenance
//! information, couldn't be constructed from a `const fn`, and would probably
//! run into other issues as well.
//!
//! The `NonNull<()>` seems like the only alternative, even if it's fairly odd
//! to use a pointer type to store something that may hold an integer, some of
//! the time.
