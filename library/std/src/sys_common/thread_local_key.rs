//! OS-based thread local storage
//!
//! This module provides an implementation of OS-based thread local storage,
//! using the native OS-provided facilities (think `TlsAlloc` or
//! `pthread_setspecific`). The interface of this differs from the other types
//! of thread-local-storage provided in this crate in that OS-based TLS can only
//! get/set pointer-sized data, possibly with an associated destructor.
//!
//! This module also provides two flavors of TLS. One is intended for static
//! initialization, and does not contain a `Drop` implementation to deallocate
//! the OS-TLS key. The other is a type which does implement `Drop` and hence
//! has a safe interface.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This module should likely not be used directly unless other primitives are
//! being built on. Types such as `thread_local::spawn::Key` are likely much
//! more useful in practice than this OS-based version which likely requires
//! unsafe code to interoperate with.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Using a dynamically allocated TLS key. Note that this key can be shared
//! among many threads via an `Arc`.
//!
//! ```ignore (cannot-doctest-private-modules)
//! let key = Key::new(None);
//! assert!(key.get().is_null());
//! key.set(1 as *mut u8);
//! assert!(!key.get().is_null());
//!
//! drop(key); // deallocate this TLS slot.
//! ```
//!
//! Sometimes a statically allocated key is either required or easier to work
//! with, however.
//!
//! ```ignore (cannot-doctest-private-modules)
//! static KEY: StaticKey = INIT;
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     assert!(KEY.get().is_null());
//!     KEY.set(1 as *mut u8);
//! }
//! ```
