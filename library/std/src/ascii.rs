//! Operations on ASCII strings and characters.
//!
//! Most string operations in Rust act on UTF-8 strings. However, at times it
//! makes more sense to only consider the ASCII character set for a specific
//! operation.
//!
//! The [`AsciiExt`] trait provides methods that allow for character
//! operations that only act on the ASCII subset and leave non-ASCII characters
//! alone.
//!
//! The [`escape_default`] function provides an iterator over the bytes of an
//! escaped version of the character given.

/// Extension methods for ASCII-subset only operations.
///
/// Be aware that operations on seemingly non-ASCII characters can sometimes
/// have unexpected results. Consider this example:
///
/// ```
/// use std::ascii::AsciiExt;
///
/// assert_eq!(AsciiExt::to_ascii_uppercase("café"), "CAFÉ");
/// assert_eq!(AsciiExt::to_ascii_uppercase("café"), "CAFé");
/// ```
///
/// In the first example, the lowercased string is represented `"cafe\u{301}"`
/// (the last character is an acute accent [combining character]). Unlike the
/// other characters in the string, the combining character will not get mapped
/// to an uppercase variant, resulting in `"CAFE\u{301}"`. In the second
/// example, the lowercased string is represented `"caf\u{e9}"` (the last
/// character is a single Unicode character representing an 'e' with an acute
/// accent). Since the last character is defined outside the scope of ASCII,
/// it will not get mapped to an uppercase variant, resulting in `"CAF\u{e9}"`.
///
