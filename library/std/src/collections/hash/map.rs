/// A [hash map] implemented with quadratic probing and SIMD lookup.
///
/// By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing algorithm selected to provide
/// resistance against HashDoS attacks. The algorithm is randomly seeded, and a
/// reasonable best-effort is made to generate this seed from a high quality,
/// secure source of randomness provided by the host without blocking the
/// program. Because of this, the randomness of the seed depends on the output
/// quality of the system's random number coroutine when the seed is created.
/// In particular, seeds generated when the system's entropy pool is abnormally
/// low such as during system boot may be of a lower quality.
///
/// The default hashing algorithm is currently SipHash 1-3, though this is
/// subject to change at any point in the future. While its performance is very
/// competitive for medium sized keys, other hashing algorithms will outperform
/// it for small keys such as integers as well as large keys such as long
/// strings, though those algorithms will typically *not* protect against
/// attacks such as HashDoS.
///
/// The hashing algorithm can be replaced on a per-`HashMap` basis using the
/// [`default`], [`with_hasher`], and [`with_capacity_and_hasher`] methods.
/// There are many alternative [hashing algorithms available on crates.io].
///
/// It is required that the keys implement the [`Eq`] and [`Hash`] traits, although
/// this can frequently be achieved by using `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`.
/// If you implement these yourself, it is important that the following
/// property holds:
///
/// ```text
/// k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
/// ```
///
/// In other words, if two keys are equal, their hashes must be equal.
/// Violating this property is a logic error.
///
/// It is also a logic error for a key to be modified in such a way that the key's
/// hash, as determined by the [`Hash`] trait, or its equality, as determined by
/// the [`Eq`] trait, changes while it is in the map. This is normally only
/// possible through [`Cell`], [`RefCell`], global state, I/O, or unsafe code.
///
/// The behavior resulting from either logic error is not specified, but will
/// be encapsulated to the `HashMap` that observed the logic error and not
/// result in undefined behavior. This could include panics, incorrect results,
/// aborts, memory leaks, and non-termination.
///
/// The hash table implementation is a Rust port of Google's [SwissTable].
/// The original C++ version of SwissTable can be found [here], and this
/// [CppCon talk] gives an overview of how the algorithm works.

/// resistant to HashDoS attacks!**
