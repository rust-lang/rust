/// An object providing access to an open file on the filesystem.
///
/// An instance of a `File` can be read and/or written depending on what options
/// it was opened with. Files also implement [`Seek`] to alter the logical cursor
/// that the file contains internally.
///
/// Files are automatically closed when they go out of scope.  Errors detected
/// on closing are ignored by the implementation of `Drop`.  Use the method
/// [`sync_all`] if these errors must be manually handled.
///
/// `File` does not buffer reads and writes. For efficiency, consider wrapping the
/// file in a [`BufReader`] or [`BufWriter`] when performing many small [`read`]
/// or [`write`] calls, unless unbuffered reads and writes are required.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Creates a new file and write bytes to it (you can also use [`write`]):
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::fs::File;
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
///
/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
///     let mut file = File::create("foo.txt")?;
///     file.write_all(b"Hello, world!")?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Reads the contents of a file into a [`String`] (you can also use [`read`]):
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::fs::File;
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
///
/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
///     let mut file = File::open("foo.txt")?;
///     let mut contents = String::new();
///     file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
///     assert_eq!(contents, "Hello, world!");
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Using a buffered [`Read`]er:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::fs::File;
/// use std::io::BufReader;
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
///
/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
///     let file = File::open("foo.txt")?;
///     let mut buf_reader = BufReader::new(file);
///     let mut contents = String::new();
///     buf_reader.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
///     assert_eq!(contents, "Hello, world!");
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that, although read and write methods require a `&mut File`, because
/// of the interfaces for [`Read`] and [`Write`], the holder of a `&File` can
/// still modify the file, either through methods that take `&File` or by
/// retrieving the underlying OS object and modifying the file that way.
/// Additionally, many operating systems allow concurrent modification of files
/// by different processes. Avoid assuming that holding a `&File` means that the
/// file will not change.
///
/// # Platform-specific behavior
///
/// On Windows, the implementation of [`Read`] and [`Write`] traits for `File`
/// perform synchronous I/O operations. Therefore the underlying file must not
/// have been opened for asynchronous I/O (e.g. by using `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`).
