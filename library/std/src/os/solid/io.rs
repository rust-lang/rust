//! SOLID-specific extensions to general I/O primitives
//!
//! Just like raw pointers, raw SOLID Sockets file descriptors point to
//! resources with dynamic lifetimes, and they can dangle if they outlive their
//! resources or be forged if they're created from invalid values.
//!
//! This module provides three types for representing raw file descriptors
//! with different ownership properties: raw, borrowed, and owned, which are
//! analogous to types used for representing pointers:
//!
//! | Type               | Analogous to |
//! | ------------------ | ------------ |
//! | [`RawFd`]          | `*const _`   |
//! | [`BorrowedFd<'a>`] | `&'a _`      |
//! | [`OwnedFd`]        | `Box<_>`     |
//!
//! Like raw pointers, `RawFd` values are primitive values. And in new code,
//! they should be considered unsafe to do I/O on (analogous to dereferencing
//! them). Rust did not always provide this guidance, so existing code in the
//! Rust ecosystem often doesn't mark `RawFd` usage as unsafe. Once the
//! `io_safety` feature is stable, libraries will be encouraged to migrate,
//! either by adding `unsafe` to APIs that dereference `RawFd` values, or by
//! using to `BorrowedFd` or `OwnedFd` instead.
//!
//! Like references, `BorrowedFd` values are tied to a lifetime, to ensure
//! that they don't outlive the resource they point to. These are safe to
//! use. `BorrowedFd` values may be used in APIs which provide safe access to
//! any system call except for:
//!
//!  - `close`, because that would end the dynamic lifetime of the resource
//!    without ending the lifetime of the file descriptor.
//!
//!  - `dup2`/`dup3`, in the second argument, because this argument is
//!    closed and assigned a new resource, which may break the assumptions
//!    other code using that file descriptor.
//!
//! `BorrowedFd` values may be used in APIs which provide safe access to `dup`
//! system calls, so types implementing `AsFd` or `From<OwnedFd>` should not
//! assume they always have exclusive access to the underlying file
//! description.
//!
//! Like boxes, `OwnedFd` values conceptually own the resource they point to,
//! and free (close) it when they are dropped.
//!
