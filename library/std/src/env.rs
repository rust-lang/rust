//! Inspection and manipulation of the process's environment.
//!
//! This module contains functions to inspect various aspects such as
//! environment variables, process arguments, the current directory, and various
//! other important directories.
//!
//! There are several functions and structs in this module that have a
//! counterpart ending in `os`. Those ending in `os` will return an [`OsString`]
//! and those without will return a [`String`].

///
/// 1. You get the path to the current executable using `current_exe()`, and
///    store it in a variable.
/// 2. Time passes. A malicious actor removes the current executable, and
///    replaces it with a malicious one.
/// 3. You then use the stored path to re-execute the current
///    executable.
///
/// You expected to safely execute the current executable, but you're
/// instead executing something completely different. The code you
/// just executed run with your privileges.
///
/// This sort of behavior has been known to [lead to privilege escalation] when
/// used incorrectly.
