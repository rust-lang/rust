//! A module for working with processes.
//!
//! This module is mostly concerned with spawning and interacting with child
//! processes, but it also provides [`abort`] and [`exit`] for terminating the
//! current process.
//!
//! # Spawning a process
//!
//! The [`Command`] struct is used to configure and spawn processes:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::process::Command;
//!
//! let output = Command::new("echo")
//!     .arg("Hello world")
//!     .output()
//!     .expect("Failed to execute command");
//!
//! assert_eq!(b"Hello world\n", output.stdout.as_slice());
//! ```
//!
//! Several methods on [`Command`], such as [`spawn`] or [`output`], can be used
//! to spawn a process. In particular, [`output`] spawns the child process and
//! waits until the process terminates, while [`spawn`] will return a [`Child`]
//! that represents the spawned child process.
//!
//! # Handling I/O
//!
//! The [`stdout`], [`stdin`], and [`stderr`] of a child process can be
//! configured by passing an [`Stdio`] to the corresponding method on
//! [`Command`]. Once spawned, they can be accessed from the [`Child`]. For
//! example, piping output from one command into another command can be done
//! like so:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
//!
//! // stdout must be configured with `Stdio::piped` in order to use
//! // `echo_child.stdout`
//! let echo_child = Command::new("echo")
//!     .arg("Oh no, a tpyo!")
//!     .stdout(Stdio::piped())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .expect("Failed to start echo process");
//!
//! // Note that `echo_child` is moved here, but we won't be needing
//! // `echo_child` anymore
//! let echo_out = echo_child.stdout.expect("Failed to open echo stdout");
//!
//! let mut sed_child = Command::new("sed")
//!     .arg("s/tpyo/typo/")
//!     .stdin(Stdio::from(echo_out))
//!     .stdout(Stdio::piped())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .expect("Failed to start sed process");
//!
//! let output = sed_child.wait_with_output().expect("Failed to wait on sed");
//! assert_eq!(b"Oh no, a typo!\n", output.stdout.as_slice());
//! ```
//!
//! Note that [`ChildStderr`] and [`ChildStdout`] implement [`Read`] and
//! [`ChildStdin`] implements [`Write`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
//! use std::io::Write;
//!
//! let mut child = Command::new("/bin/cat")
//!     .stdin(Stdio::piped())
//!     .stdout(Stdio::piped())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .expect("failed to execute child");
//!
//! // If the child process fills its stdout buffer, it may end up
//! // waiting until the parent reads the stdout, and not be able to
//! // read stdin in the meantime, causing a deadlock.
//! // Writing from another thread ensures that stdout is being read
//! // at the same time, avoiding the problem.
//! let mut stdin = child.stdin.take().expect("failed to get stdin");
//! std::thread::spawn(move || {
//!     stdin.write_all(b"test").expect("failed to write to stdin");
//! });
//!
//! let output = child
//!     .wait_with_output()
//!     .expect("failed to wait on child");
//!
//! assert_eq!(b"test", output.stdout.as_slice());
//! ```
//!
//! # Windows argument splitting
//!
//! On Unix systems arguments are passed to a new process as an array of strings,
//! but on Windows arguments are passed as a single commandline string and it is
//! up to the child process to parse it into an array. Therefore the parent and
//! child processes must agree on how the commandline string is encoded.
//!
//! Most programs use the standard C run-time `argv`, which in practice results
//! in consistent argument handling. However, some programs have their own way of
//! parsing the commandline string. In these cases using [`arg`] or [`args`] may
//! result in the child process seeing a different array of arguments than the
//! parent process intended.
//!
//! Two ways of mitigating this are:
//!
//! * Validate untrusted input so that only a safe subset is allowed.
//! * Use [`raw_arg`] to build a custom commandline. This bypasses the escaping
//!   rules used by [`arg`] so should be used with due caution.
//!
//! `cmd.exe` and `.bat` files use non-standard argument parsing and are especially
//! vulnerable to malicious input as they may be used to run arbitrary shell
//! commands. Untrusted arguments should be restricted as much as possible.
//! For examples on handling this see [`raw_arg`].
//!
//! ### Batch file special handling
//!
//! On Windows, `Command` uses the Windows API function [`CreateProcessW`] to
//! spawn new processes. An undocumented feature of this function is that
//! when given a `.bat` file as the application to run, it will automatically
//! convert that into running `cmd.exe /c` with the batch file as the next argument.
//!
//! For historical reasons Rust currently preserves this behavior when using
//! [`Command::new`], and escapes the arguments according to `cmd.exe` rules.
//! Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe` argument handling, it might not be
//! possible to safely escape some special characters, and using them will result
//! in an error being returned at process spawn. The set of unescapeable
//! special characters might change between releases.
//!
//! Also note that running batch scripts in this way may be removed in the
//! future and so should not be relied upon.

/// Representation of a running or exited child process.
///
/// This structure is used to represent and manage child processes. A child
/// process is created via the [`Command`] struct, which configures the
/// spawning process and can itself be constructed using a builder-style
/// interface.
///
/// There is no implementation of [`Drop`] for child processes,
/// so if you do not ensure the `Child` has exited then it will continue to
/// run, even after the `Child` handle to the child process has gone out of
/// scope.
///
/// Calling [`wait`] (or other functions that wrap around it) will make
/// the parent process wait until the child has actually exited before
/// continuing.
///
/// # Warning
///
/// On some systems, calling [`wait`] or similar is necessary for the OS to
/// release resources. A process that terminated but has not been waited on is
/// still around as a "zombie". Leaving too many zombies around may exhaust
/// global resources (for example process IDs).
///
/// The standard library does *not* automatically wait on child processes (not
/// even if the `Child` is dropped), it is up to the application developer to do
/// so. As a consequence, dropping `Child` handles without waiting on them first
/// is not recommended in long-running applications.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```should_panic
/// use std::process::Command;
///
/// let mut child = Command::new("/bin/cat")
///     .arg("file.txt")
///     .spawn()
///     .expect("failed to execute child");

/// [`Termination`]:
///
/// ```
/// use std::process::ExitCode;
/// # fn check_foo() -> bool { true }

/// fn main() -> ExitCode {
///     if !check_foo() {
