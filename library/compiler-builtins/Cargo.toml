# Marks all intrinsics functions with weak linkage so that they can be
# replaced at link time by another implementation. This is particularly useful
# for mixed Rust/C++ binaries that want to use the C++ intrinsics, otherwise
# linking against the Rust stdlib will replace those from the compiler-rt
# library.
#
# Unlike the "c" feature, the intrinsics are still provided by the Rust
# implementations and each will be used unless a stronger symbol replaces
# it during linking.
