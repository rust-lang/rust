# NOTE: Must be kept in sync with `../compiler-builtins/Cargo.toml`.
#
# The manifest at `../compiler-builtins` is what actually gets used in the
# rust-lang/rust tree; however, we can't build it out of tree because it
# depends on `core` by path, and even optional Cargo dependencies need to be
# available at build time. So, we work around this by having this "shim"
# manifest that is identical except for the `core` dependency and forwards
# to the same sources, which acts as the `compiler-builtins` Cargo entrypoint
# for out of tree testing
