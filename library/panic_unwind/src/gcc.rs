//! Implementation of panics backed by libgcc/libunwind (in some form).
//!
//! For background on exception handling and stack unwinding please see
//! "Exception Handling in LLVM" (llvm.org/docs/ExceptionHandling.html) and
//! documents linked from it.
//! These are also good reads:

//!
//! ## A brief summary
//!
//! Exception handling happens in two phases: a search phase and a cleanup
//! phase.
//!
//! In both phases the unwinder walks stack frames from top to bottom using
//! information from the stack frame unwind sections of the current process's
//! modules ("module" here refers to an OS module, i.e., an executable or a
//! dynamic library).
//!
//! For each stack frame, it invokes the associated "personality routine", whose
//! address is also stored in the unwind info section.
//!
//! In the search phase, the job of a personality routine is to examine
//! exception object being thrown, and to decide whether it should be caught at
//! that stack frame. Once the handler frame has been identified, cleanup phase
//! begins.
//!
//! In the cleanup phase, the unwinder invokes each personality routine again.
//! This time it decides which (if any) cleanup code needs to be run for
//! the current stack frame. If so, the control is transferred to a special
//! branch in the function body, the "landing pad", which invokes destructors,
//! frees memory, etc. At the end of the landing pad, control is transferred
//! back to the unwinder and unwinding resumes.
//!
//! Once stack has been unwound down to the handler frame level, unwinding stops
//! and the last personality routine transfers control to the catch block.
