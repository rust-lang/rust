//! Run-time feature detection utility for RISC-V.
//!
//! On RISC-V, full feature detection needs a help of one or more
//! feature detection mechanisms (usually provided by the operating system).
//!
//! RISC-V architecture defines many extensions and some have dependency to others.
//! More importantly, some of them cannot be enabled without resolving such
//! dependencies due to limited set of features that such mechanisms provide.
//!
//! This module provides an OS-independent utility to process such relations
//! between RISC-V extensions.

///
/// Note that it does not perform any consistency checks including existence of
/// conflicting extensions and/or complicated requirements.  Eliminating such
/// inconsistencies is the responsibility of the feature detection logic and
