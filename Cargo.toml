# that this number doesn't actually produce this many object files, we
# just don't create more than this number of object files.
#
# It's a bit of a bummer that we have to pass this here, unfortunately.

# knows how many CGUs are for this specific crate, but for now
# per-crate configuration isn't specifiable in the environment.
