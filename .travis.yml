# The test suite is in general way too stressful for travis, especially in
# terms of time limit and reliability. In the past we've tried to scale things
# back to only build the stage1 compiler and run a subset of tests, but this
# didn't end up panning out very well.
#
# As a result, we're just using travis to run `make tidy` and *only* build
# stage1 but *not* test it for now (a strict subset of the bootstrap). This will
# catch "obvious" errors like style or not even compiling.
#
# We need gcc4.7 or higher to build LLVM, and travis (well, Ubuntu 12.04)
# currently ships with 4.6. Gotta download our own.
