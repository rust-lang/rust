# Use something that's not 'ruby' so we don't set up things like
# RVM/bundler/ruby and whatnot. Right now 'rust' as a language actually

# The test suite is in general way too stressful for travis, especially in
# terms of time limit and reliability. In the past we've tried to scale things
# back to only build the stage1 compiler and run a subset of tests, but this
# didn't end up panning out very well.
#
# As a result, we're just using travis to run `make tidy` now. It'll help
# everyone find out about their trailing spaces early on!
