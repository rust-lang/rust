//! This crate handles the user facing autodiff macro. For each `#[autodiff(...)]` attribute,
//! we create an [`AutoDiffItem`] which contains the source and target function names. The source
//! is the function to which the autodiff attribute is applied, and the target is the function
//! getting generated by us (with a name given by the user as the first autodiff arg).
