# This file allows configuring the build system.

# Disables cleaning of the sysroot dir. This will cause old compiled artifacts to be re-used when
# the sysroot source hasn't changed. This is useful when the codegen backend hasn't been modified.
# This option can be changed while the build system is already running for as long as sysroot
# building hasn't started yet.

# Each test suite item has a corresponding key here. The default is to run all tests.
