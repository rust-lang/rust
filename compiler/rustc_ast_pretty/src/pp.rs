//! This pretty-printer is a direct reimplementation of Philip Karlton's
//! Mesa pretty-printer, as described in the appendix to
//! Derek C. Oppen, "Pretty Printing" (1979),
//! Stanford Computer Science Department STAN-CS-79-770,
//! <http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/79/770/CS-TR-79-770.pdf>.
//!
//! The algorithm's aim is to break a stream into as few lines as possible
//! while respecting the indentation-consistency requirements of the enclosing
//! block, and avoiding breaking at silly places on block boundaries, for
//! example, between "x" and ")" in "x)".
//!
//! I am implementing this algorithm because it comes with 20 pages of
//! documentation explaining its theory, and because it addresses the set of
//! concerns I've seen other pretty-printers fall down on. Weirdly. Even though
//! it's 32 years old. What can I say?
//!
//! Despite some redundancies and quirks in the way it's implemented in that
//! paper, I've opted to keep the implementation here as similar as I can,
//! changing only what was blatantly wrong, a typo, or sufficiently
//! non-idiomatic rust that it really stuck out.
//!
//! In particular you'll see a certain amount of churn related to INTEGER vs.
//! CARDINAL in the Mesa implementation. Mesa apparently interconverts the two
//! somewhat readily? In any case, I've used usize for indices-in-buffers and
//! ints for character-sizes-and-indentation-offsets. This respects the need
//! for ints to "go negative" while carrying a pending-calculation balance, and
//! helps differentiate all the numbers flying around internally (slightly).
//!
//! I also inverted the indentation arithmetic used in the print stack, since
//! the Mesa implementation (somewhat randomly) stores the offset on the print
//! stack in terms of margin-col rather than col itself. I store col.
//!
//! I also implemented a small change in the String token, in that I store an
//! explicit length for the string. For most tokens this is just the length of
//! the accompanying string. But it's necessary to permit it to differ, for
//! encoding things that are supposed to "go on their own line" -- certain
//! classes of comment and blank-line -- where relying on adjacent
//! hardbreak-like Break tokens with long blankness indication doesn't actually
//! work. To see why, consider when there is a "thing that should be on its own
//! line" between two long blocks, say functions. If you put a hardbreak after
//! each function (or before each) and the breaking algorithm decides to break
//! there anyways (because the functions themselves are long) you wind up with
//! extra blank lines. If you don't put hardbreaks you can wind up with the
//! "thing which should be on its own line" not getting its own line in the
//! rare case of "really small functions" or such. This re-occurs with comments
//! and explicit blank lines. So in those cases we use a string with a payload
//! we want isolated to a line and an explicit length that's huge, surrounded
//! by two zero-length breaks. The algorithm will try its best to fit it on a
//! line (which it can't) and so naturally place the content on its own line to
//! avoid combining it with other lines and making matters even worse.
//!
//! # Explanation
//!
//! In case you do not have the paper, here is an explanation of what's going
//! on.
//!
//! There is a stream of input tokens flowing through this printer.
//!
//! The printer buffers up to 3N tokens inside itself, where N is linewidth.
//! Yes, linewidth is chars and tokens are multi-char, but in the worst
//! case every token worth buffering is 1 char long, so it's ok.
//!
//! Tokens are String, Break, and Begin/End to delimit blocks.
//!
//! Begin tokens can carry an offset, saying "how far to indent when you break
//! inside here", as well as a flag indicating "consistent" or "inconsistent"
//! breaking. Consistent breaking means that after the first break, no attempt
//! will be made to flow subsequent breaks together onto lines. Inconsistent
//! is the opposite. Inconsistent breaking example would be, say:
//!
//! ```ignore (illustrative)
//! foo(hello, there, good, friends)
//! ```
//!
//! breaking inconsistently to become
//!
//! ```ignore (illustrative)
//! foo(hello, there,
//!     good, friends);
//! ```
//!
//! whereas a consistent breaking would yield:
//!
//! ```ignore (illustrative)
//! foo(hello,
//!     there,
//!     good,
//!     friends);
//! ```
//!
//! That is, in the consistent-break blocks we value vertical alignment
//! more than the ability to cram stuff onto a line. But in all cases if it
//! can make a block a one-liner, it'll do so.
//!
//! Carrying on with high-level logic:
//!
//! The buffered tokens go through a ring-buffer, 'tokens'. The 'left' and
//! 'right' indices denote the active portion of the ring buffer as well as
//! describing hypothetical points-in-the-infinite-stream at most 3N tokens
//! apart (i.e., "not wrapped to ring-buffer boundaries"). The paper will switch
//! between using 'left' and 'right' terms to denote the wrapped-to-ring-buffer
//! and point-in-infinite-stream senses freely.
//!
//! There is a parallel ring buffer, `size`, that holds the calculated size of
//! each token. Why calculated? Because for Begin/End pairs, the "size"
//! includes everything between the pair. That is, the "size" of Begin is
//! actually the sum of the sizes of everything between Begin and the paired
//! End that follows. Since that is arbitrarily far in the future, `size` is
//! being rewritten regularly while the printer runs; in fact most of the
//! machinery is here to work out `size` entries on the fly (and give up when
//! they're so obviously over-long that "infinity" is a good enough
//! approximation for purposes of line breaking).
//!
//! The "input side" of the printer is managed as an abstract process called
//! SCAN, which uses `scan_stack`, to manage calculating `size`. SCAN is, in
//! other words, the process of calculating 'size' entries.
//!
//! The "output side" of the printer is managed by an abstract process called
//! PRINT, which uses `print_stack`, `margin` and `space` to figure out what to
//! do with each token/size pair it consumes as it goes. It's trying to consume
//! the entire buffered window, but can't output anything until the size is >=
//! 0 (sizes are set to negative while they're pending calculation).
//!
//! So SCAN takes input and buffers tokens and pending calculations, while
//! PRINT gobbles up completed calculations and tokens from the buffer. The
//! theory is that the two can never get more than 3N tokens apart, because
//! once there's "obviously" too much data to fit on a line, in a size
//! calculation, SCAN will write "infinity" to the size and let PRINT consume
//! it.
//!
//! In this implementation (following the paper, again) the SCAN process is the
//! methods called `Printer::scan_*`, and the 'PRINT' process is the
//! method called `Printer::print`.
