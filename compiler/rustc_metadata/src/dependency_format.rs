//! Resolution of mixing rlibs and dylibs
//!
//! When producing a final artifact, such as a dynamic library, the compiler has
//! a choice between linking an rlib or linking a dylib of all upstream
//! dependencies. The linking phase must guarantee, however, that a library only
//! show up once in the object file. For example, it is illegal for library A to
//! be statically linked to B and C in separate dylibs, and then link B and C
//! into a crate D (because library A appears twice).
//!
//! The job of this module is to calculate what format each upstream crate
//! should be used when linking each output type requested in this session. This
//! generally follows this set of rules:
//!
//! 1. Each library must appear exactly once in the output.
//! 2. Each rlib contains only one library (it's just an object file)
//! 3. Each dylib can contain more than one library (due to static linking),
//!    and can also bring in many dynamic dependencies.
//!
//! With these constraints in mind, it's generally a very difficult problem to
//! find a solution that's not "all rlibs" or "all dylibs". I have suspicions
//! that NP-ness may come into the picture here...
//!
//! The current selection algorithm below looks mostly similar to:
//!
//! 1. If static linking is required, then require all upstream dependencies
//!    to be available as rlibs. If not, generate an error.
//! 2. If static linking is requested (generating an executable), then
//!    attempt to use all upstream dependencies as rlibs. If any are not
//!    found, bail out and continue to step 3.
//! 3. Static linking has failed, at least one library must be dynamically
//!    linked. Apply a heuristic by greedily maximizing the number of
//!    dynamically linked libraries.
//! 4. Each upstream dependency available as a dynamic library is
//!    registered. The dependencies all propagate, adding to a map. It is
//!    possible for a dylib to add a static library as a dependency, but it
//!    is illegal for two dylibs to add the same static library as a
//!    dependency. The same dylib can be added twice. Additionally, it is
//!    illegal to add a static dependency when it was previously found as a
//!    dylib (and vice versa)
//! 5. After all dynamic dependencies have been traversed, re-traverse the
//!    remaining dependencies and add them statically (if they haven't been
//!    added already).
//!
//! While not perfect, this algorithm should help support use-cases such as leaf
//! dependencies being static while the larger tree of inner dependencies are
//! all dynamic. This isn't currently very well battle tested, so it will likely
//! fall short in some use cases.
//!
//! Currently, there is no way to specify the preference of linkage with a
//! particular library (other than a global dynamic/static switch).
//! Additionally, the algorithm is geared towards finding *any* solution rather
//! than finding a number of solutions (there are normally quite a few).
