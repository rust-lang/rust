//! The Rust Linkage Model and Symbol Names
//! =======================================
//!
//! The semantic model of Rust linkage is, broadly, that "there's no global
//! namespace" between crates. Our aim is to preserve the illusion of this
//! model despite the fact that it's not *quite* possible to implement on
//! modern linkers. We initially didn't use system linkers at all, but have
//! been convinced of their utility.
//!
//! There are a few issues to handle:
//!
//!  - Linkers operate on a flat namespace, so we have to flatten names.
//!    We do this using the C++ namespace-mangling technique. Foo::bar
//!    symbols and such.
//!
//!  - Symbols for distinct items with the same *name* need to get different
//!    linkage-names. Examples of this are monomorphizations of functions or
//!    items within anonymous scopes that end up having the same path.
//!
//!  - Symbols in different crates but with same names "within" the crate need
//!    to get different linkage-names.
//!
//!  - Symbol names should be deterministic: Two consecutive runs of the
//!    compiler over the same code base should produce the same symbol names for
//!    the same items.
//!
//!  - Symbol names should not depend on any global properties of the code base,
//!    so that small modifications to the code base do not result in all symbols
//!    changing. In previous versions of the compiler, symbol names incorporated
//!    the SVH (Stable Version Hash) of the crate. This scheme turned out to be
//!    infeasible when used in conjunction with incremental compilation because
//!    small code changes would invalidate all symbols generated previously.
//!
//!  - Even symbols from different versions of the same crate should be able to
//!    live next to each other without conflict.
//!
//! In order to fulfill the above requirements the following scheme is used by
//! the compiler:
//!
//! The main tool for avoiding naming conflicts is the incorporation of a 64-bit
//! hash value into every exported symbol name. Anything that makes a difference
//! to the symbol being named, but does not show up in the regular path needs to
//! be fed into this hash:
//!
//! - Different monomorphizations of the same item have the same path but differ
//!   in their concrete type parameters, so these parameters are part of the
//!   data being digested for the symbol hash.
//!
//! - Rust allows items to be defined in anonymous scopes, such as in
//!   `fn foo() { { fn bar() {} } { fn bar() {} } }`. Both `bar` functions have
//!   the path `foo::bar`, since the anonymous scopes do not contribute to the
//!   path of an item. The compiler already handles this case via so-called
//!   disambiguating `DefPaths` which use indices to distinguish items with the
//!   same name. The DefPaths of the functions above are thus `foo[0]::bar[0]`
//!   and `foo[0]::bar[1]`. In order to incorporate this disambiguation
//!   information into the symbol name too, these indices are fed into the
//!   symbol hash, so that the above two symbols would end up with different
//!   hash values.
//!
//! The two measures described above suffice to avoid intra-crate conflicts. In
//! order to also avoid inter-crate conflicts two more measures are taken:
//!
//! - The name of the crate containing the symbol is prepended to the symbol
//!   name, i.e., symbols are "crate qualified". For example, a function `foo` in
//!   module `bar` in crate `baz` would get a symbol name like
//!   `baz::bar::foo::{hash}` instead of just `bar::foo::{hash}`. This avoids
//!   simple conflicts between functions from different crates.
//!
//! - In order to be able to also use symbols from two versions of the same
//!   crate (which naturally also have the same name), a stronger measure is
//!   required: The compiler accepts an arbitrary "disambiguator" value via the
//!   `-C metadata` command-line argument. This disambiguator is then fed into
//!   the symbol hash of every exported item. Consequently, the symbols in two
//!   identical crates but with different disambiguators are not in conflict
//!   with each other. This facility is mainly intended to be used by build
//!   tools like Cargo.
//!
//! A note on symbol name stability
//! -------------------------------
//! Previous versions of the compiler resorted to feeding NodeIds into the
//! symbol hash in order to disambiguate between items with the same path. The
//! current version of the name generation algorithm takes great care not to do
//! that, since NodeIds are notoriously unstable: A small change to the
//! code base will offset all NodeIds after the change and thus, much as using
//! the SVH in the hash, invalidate an unbounded number of symbol names. This
//! makes re-using previously compiled code for incremental compilation
//! virtually impossible. Thus, symbol hash generation exclusively relies on
//! DefPaths which are much more robust in the face of changes to the code base.
