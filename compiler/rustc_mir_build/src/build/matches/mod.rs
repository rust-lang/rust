    /// Once we pick what sort of test we are going to perform, this test will help us winnow down
    /// our candidates. So we walk over the candidates (from high to low priority) and check. We
    /// compute, for each outcome of the test, a list of (modified) candidates. If a candidate
    /// matches in exactly one branch of our test, we add it to the corresponding outcome. We also
    /// **mutate its list of match pairs** if appropriate, to reflect the fact that we know which
    /// outcome occurred.
    ///
    /// For example, if we are testing `x.0`'s variant, and we have a candidate `(x.0 @ Some(v), x.1
    /// @ 22)`, then we would have a resulting candidate of `((x.0 as Some).0 @ v, x.1 @ 22)` in the
    /// branch corresponding to `Some`. To ensure we make progress, we always pick a test that
    /// results in simplifying the first candidate.
    ///
    /// But there may also be candidates that the test doesn't
    /// apply to. The classical example is wildcards:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # let (x, y, z) = (true, true, true);
    /// match (x, y, z) {
    ///     (true , _    , true ) => true,  // (0)
    ///     (false, false, _    ) => false, // (1)
    ///     (_    , true , _    ) => true,  // (2)
    ///     (true , _    , false) => false, // (3)
    /// }
    /// # ;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here, the traditional "decision tree" method would generate 2 separate code-paths for the 2
    /// possible values of `x`. This would however duplicate some candidates, which would need to be
    /// lowered several times.
    ///
    /// In some cases, this duplication can create an exponential amount of
    /// code. This is most easily seen by noticing that this method terminates
    /// with precisely the reachable arms being reachable - but that problem
    /// is trivially NP-complete:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// match (var0, var1, var2, var3, ...) {
    ///     (true , _   , _    , false, true, ...) => false,
    ///     (_    , true, true , false, _   , ...) => false,
    ///     (false, _   , false, false, _   , ...) => false,
    ///     ...
    ///     _ => true
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here the last arm is reachable only if there is an assignment to
    /// the variables that does not match any of the literals. Therefore,
    /// compilation would take an exponential amount of time in some cases.
    ///
    /// In rustc, we opt instead for the "backtracking automaton" approach. This guarantees we never
    /// duplicate a candidate (except in the presence of or-patterns). In fact this guarantee is
    /// ensured by the fact that we carry around `&mut Candidate`s which can't be duplicated.
    ///
    /// To make this work, whenever we decide to perform a test, if we encounter a candidate that
    /// could match in more than one branch of the test, we stop. We generate code for the test and
    /// for the candidates in its branches; the remaining candidates will be tested if the
    /// candidates in the branches fail to match.
    ///
    /// For example, if we test on `x` in the following:
    /// ```
    /// # fn foo((x, y, z): (bool, bool, bool)) -> u32 {
    /// match (x, y, z) {
    ///     (true , _    , true ) => 0,

    ///     (true , _    , false) => 3,
    /// }
    /// # }
    /// ```

    /// The idea is that any pattern bindings of type T will map to a `&T` within
    /// the context of the guard expression, but will continue to map to a `T`
    /// in the context of the arm body. To avoid surfacing this distinction in
    /// the user source code (which would be a severe change to the language and
    /// require far more revision to the compiler), any occurrence of the
    /// identifier in the guard expression will automatically get a deref op
    /// applied to it. (See the caller of [`Self::is_bound_var_in_guard`].)
    ///
    /// So an input like:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// let place = Foo::new();
    /// match place { foo if inspect(foo)
    ///     => feed(foo), ... }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// will be treated as if it were really something like:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// let place = Foo::new();
    /// match place { Foo { .. } if { let tmp1 = &place; inspect(*tmp1) }
    ///     => { let tmp2 = place; feed(tmp2) }, ... }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// And an input like:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// let place = Foo::new();
    /// match place { ref mut foo if inspect(foo)
    ///     => feed(foo), ... }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// will be treated as if it were really something like:
    ///
    /// ```ignore (illustrative)
    /// let place = Foo::new();
    /// match place { Foo { .. } if { let tmp1 = & &mut place; inspect(*tmp1) }
    ///     => { let tmp2 = &mut place; feed(tmp2) }, ... }
    /// ```
    /// ---
    ///
    /// ## Implementation notes
    ///
    /// To encode the distinction above, we must inject the
    /// temporaries `tmp1` and `tmp2`.
    ///
    /// There are two cases of interest: binding by-value, and binding by-ref.
    ///
    /// 1. Binding by-value: Things are simple.
    ///
    ///    * Establishing `tmp1` creates a reference into the
    ///      matched place. This code is emitted by
    ///      [`Self::bind_matched_candidate_for_guard`].
    ///
    ///    * `tmp2` is only initialized "lazily", after we have
    ///      checked the guard. Thus, the code that can trigger
    ///      moves out of the candidate can only fire after the
    ///      guard evaluated to true. This initialization code is
    ///      emitted by [`Self::bind_matched_candidate_for_arm_body`].
    ///
    /// 2. Binding by-reference: Things are tricky.
    ///
    ///    * Here, the guard expression wants a `&&` or `&&mut`
    ///      into the original input. This means we need to borrow
    ///      the reference that we create for the arm.
    ///    * So we eagerly create the reference for the arm and then take a
    ///      reference to that.
