    /// not necessarily implement `Drop` itself. Naïvely, one might be tempted
    /// to write an implementation that assumes that a type can be trivially
    /// dropped while also supplying a specialization for `T: Drop` that
    /// actually calls the destructor. However, this breaks down e.g. when `T`
    /// is `String`, which does not implement `Drop` itself but contains a
    /// `Vec`, which does implement `Drop`, so assuming `T` can be trivially
    /// dropped would lead to a memory leak here.
    ///
    /// Furthermore, the `Drop` trait only contains one method, `Drop::drop`,
    /// which may not be called explicitly in user code (`E0040`), so there is
