//! The `ObligationForest` is a utility data structure used in trait
//! matching to track the set of outstanding obligations (those not yet
//! resolved to success or error). It also tracks the "backtrace" of each
//! pending obligation (why we are trying to figure this out in the first
//! place).
//!
//! ### External view
//!
//! `ObligationForest` supports two main public operations (there are a
//! few others not discussed here):
//!
//! 1. Add a new root obligations (`register_obligation`).
//! 2. Process the pending obligations (`process_obligations`).
//!
//! When a new obligation `N` is added, it becomes the root of an
//! obligation tree. This tree can also carry some per-tree state `T`,
//! which is given at the same time. This tree is a singleton to start, so
//! `N` is both the root and the only leaf. Each time the
//! `process_obligations` method is called, it will invoke its callback
//! with every pending obligation (so that will include `N`, the first
//! time). The callback also receives a (mutable) reference to the
//! per-tree state `T`. The callback should process the obligation `O`
//! that it is given and return a `ProcessResult`:
//!
//! - `Unchanged` -> ambiguous result. Obligation was neither a success
//!   nor a failure. It is assumed that further attempts to process the
//!   obligation will yield the same result unless something in the
//!   surrounding environment changes.
//! - `Changed(C)` - the obligation was *shallowly successful*. The
//!   vector `C` is a list of subobligations. The meaning of this is that
//!   `O` was successful on the assumption that all the obligations in `C`
//!   are also successful. Therefore, `O` is only considered a "true"
//!   success if `C` is empty. Otherwise, `O` is put into a suspended
//!   state and the obligations in `C` become the new pending
//!   obligations. They will be processed the next time you call
//!   `process_obligations`.
//! - `Error(E)` -> obligation failed with error `E`. We will collect this
//!   error and return it from `process_obligations`, along with the
//!   "backtrace" of obligations (that is, the list of obligations up to
//!   and including the root of the failed obligation). No further
//!   obligations from that same tree will be processed, since the tree is
//!   now considered to be in error.
//!
//! When the call to `process_obligations` completes, you get back an `Outcome`,
//! which includes two bits of information:
//!
//! - `completed`: a list of obligations where processing was fully
//!   completed without error (meaning that all transitive subobligations
//!   have also been completed). So, for example, if the callback from
//!   `process_obligations` returns `Changed(C)` for some obligation `O`,
//!   then `O` will be considered completed right away if `C` is the
//!   empty vector. Otherwise it will only be considered completed once
//!   all the obligations in `C` have been found completed.
//! - `errors`: a list of errors that occurred and associated backtraces
//!   at the time of error, which can be used to give context to the user.
//!
//! Upon completion, none of the existing obligations were *shallowly
//! successful* (that is, no callback returned `Changed(_)`). This implies that
//! all obligations were either errors or returned an ambiguous result.
//!
//! ### Implementation details
//!
//! For the most part, comments specific to the implementation are in the
//! code. This file only contains a very high-level overview. Basically,
//! the forest is stored in a vector. Each element of the vector is a node
//! in some tree. Each node in the vector has the index of its dependents,
//! including the first dependent which is known as the parent. It also
//! has a current state, described by `NodeState`. After each processing
//! step, we compress the vector to remove completed and error nodes, which
//! aren't needed anymore.
