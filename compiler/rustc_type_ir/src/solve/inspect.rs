//! Data structure used to inspect trait solver behavior.
//!
//! During trait solving we optionally build "proof trees", the root of
//! which is a [GoalEvaluation]. These  trees are used by the compiler
//! to inspect the behavior of the trait solver and to access its internal
//! state, e.g. for diagnostics and when selecting impls during codegen.
//!
//! Because each nested goal in the solver gets [canonicalized] separately
//! and we discard inference progress via "probes", we cannot mechanically
//! use proof trees without somehow "lifting up" data local to the current
//! `InferCtxt`. To use the data from evaluation we therefore canonicalize
//! it and store it as a [CanonicalState].
//!
//! Proof trees are only shallow, we do not compute the proof tree for nested
//! goals. Visiting proof trees instead recomputes nested goals in the parents
//! inference context when necessary.
//!
//! [canonicalized]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/solve/canonicalization.html
