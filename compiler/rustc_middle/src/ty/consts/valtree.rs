/// Since CTFE uses `AllocId` to represent pointers, it often happens that two different
/// `AllocId`s point to equal values. So we may end up with different representations for
/// two constants whose value is `&42`. Furthermore any kind of struct that has padding will
/// have arbitrary values within that padding, even if the values of the struct are the same.
