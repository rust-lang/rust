/// other words, the same [`Body`](crate::mir::Body) might be well-formed for multiple dialects, but
/// have different semantic meaning and different behavior at runtime.
///
/// Each dialect additionally has a number of phases. However, phase changes never involve semantic
/// changes. If some MIR is well-formed both before and after a phase change, it is also guaranteed
/// that it has the same semantic meaning. In this sense, phase changes can only add additional
/// restrictions on what MIR is well-formed.

    /// The semantic changes that occur in the lowering from analysis to runtime MIR are as follows:
    ///
    ///  - Drops: In analysis MIR, `Drop` terminators represent *conditional* drops; roughly speaking,
    ///    if dataflow analysis determines that the place being dropped is uninitialized, the drop will
    ///    not be executed. The exact semantics of this aren't written down anywhere, which means they

    ///    when a `Drop` terminator is reached, if the type has drop glue that drop glue is always
    ///    executed. This may be UB if the underlying place is not initialized.
    ///  - Packed drops: Places might in general be misaligned - in most cases this is UB, the exception
    ///    is fields of packed structs. In analysis MIR, `Drop(P)` for a `P` that might be misaligned
    ///    for this reason implicitly moves `P` to a temporary before dropping. Runtime MIR has no such
    ///    rules, and dropping a misaligned place is simply UB.
    ///  - Unwinding: in analysis MIR, unwinding from a function which may not unwind aborts. In runtime
    ///    MIR, this is UB.
    ///  - Retags: If `-Zmir-emit-retag` is enabled, analysis MIR has "implicit" retags in the same way
    ///    that Rust itself has them. Where exactly these are is generally subject to change, and so we
    ///    don't document this here. Runtime MIR has most retags explicit (though implicit retags
    ///    can still occur at `Rvalue::{Ref,AddrOf}`).
    ///  - Generator bodies: In analysis MIR, locals may actually be behind a pointer that user code has
    ///    access to. This occurs in generator bodies. Such locals do not behave like other locals,
    ///    because they eg may be aliased in surprising ways. Runtime MIR has no such special locals -
    ///    all generator bodies are lowered and so all places that look like locals really are locals.
    ///
    /// Also note that the lint pass which reports eg `200_u8 + 200_u8` as an error is run as a part
    /// of analysis to runtime MIR lowering. To ensure lints are reported reliably, this means that
    /// transformations which may suppress such errors should not run on analysis MIR.

// Places

/// Places roughly correspond to a "location in memory." Places in MIR are the same mathematical
/// object as places in Rust. This of course means that what exactly they are is undecided and part
/// of the Rust memory model. However, they will likely contain at least the following pieces of
/// information in some form:
///
///  1. The address in memory that the place refers to.
///  2. The provenance with which the place is being accessed.
///  3. The type of the place and an optional variant index. See [`PlaceTy`][super::tcx::PlaceTy].
///  4. Optionally, some metadata. This exists if and only if the type of the place is not `Sized`.
///
/// We'll give a description below of how all pieces of the place except for the provenance are
/// calculated. We cannot give a description of the provenance, because that is part of the
/// undecided aliasing model - we only include it here at all to acknowledge its existence.
///
/// Each local naturally corresponds to the place `Place { local, projection: [] }`. This place has
/// the address of the local's allocation and the type of the local.
///
/// **Needs clarification:** Unsized locals seem to present a bit of an issue. Their allocation
/// can't actually be created on `StorageLive`, because it's unclear how big to make the allocation.
/// Furthermore, MIR produces assignments to unsized locals, although that is not permitted under
/// `#![feature(unsized_locals)]` in Rust. Besides just putting "unsized locals are special and
/// different" in a bunch of places, I (JakobDegen) don't know how to incorporate this behavior into
/// the current MIR semantics in a clean way - possibly this needs some design work first.
///
/// For places that are not locals, ie they have a non-empty list of projections, we define the
/// values as a function of the parent place, that is the place with its last [`ProjectionElem`]
/// stripped. The way this is computed of course depends on the kind of that last projection
/// element:
///
///  - [`Downcast`](ProjectionElem::Downcast): This projection sets the place's variant index to the
///    given one, and makes no other changes. A `Downcast` projection on a place with its variant
///    index already set is not well-formed.
///  - [`Field`](ProjectionElem::Field): `Field` projections take their parent place and create a
///    place referring to one of the fields of the type. The resulting address is the parent
///    address, plus the offset of the field. The type becomes the type of the field. If the parent
///    was unsized and so had metadata associated with it, then the metadata is retained if the
///    field is unsized and thrown out if it is sized.
///
///    These projections are only legal for tuples, ADTs, closures, and generators. If the ADT or
///    generator has more than one variant, the parent place's variant index must be set, indicating
///    which variant is being used. If it has just one variant, the variant index may or may not be
///    included - the single possible variant is inferred if it is not included.
///  - [`OpaqueCast`](ProjectionElem::OpaqueCast): This projection changes the place's type to the
///    given one, and makes no other changes. A `OpaqueCast` projection on any type other than an
///    opaque type from the current crate is not well-formed.
///  - [`ConstantIndex`](ProjectionElem::ConstantIndex): Computes an offset in units of `T` into the
///    place as described in the documentation for the `ProjectionElem`. The resulting address is
///    the parent's address plus that offset, and the type is `T`. This is only legal if the parent
///    place has type `[T;  N]` or `[T]` (*not* `&[T]`). Since such a `T` is always sized, any
///    resulting metadata is thrown out.
///  - [`Subslice`](ProjectionElem::Subslice): This projection calculates an offset and a new
///    address in a similar manner as `ConstantIndex`. It is also only legal on `[T; N]` and `[T]`.
///    However, this yields a `Place` of type `[T]`, and additionally sets the metadata to be the
///    length of the subslice.
///  - [`Index`](ProjectionElem::Index): Like `ConstantIndex`, only legal on `[T; N]` or `[T]`.
///    However, `Index` additionally takes a local from which the value of the index is computed at
///    runtime. Computing the value of the index involves interpreting the `Local` as a
///    `Place { local, projection: [] }`, and then computing its value as if done via
///    [`Operand::Copy`]. The array/slice is then indexed with the resulting value. The local must
///    have type `usize`.
///  - [`Deref`](ProjectionElem::Deref): Derefs are the last type of projection, and the most
///    complicated. They are only legal on parent places that are references, pointers, or `Box`. A
///    `Deref` projection begins by loading a value from the parent place, as if by
///    [`Operand::Copy`]. It then dereferences the resulting pointer, creating a place of the
///    pointee's type. The resulting address is the address that was stored in the pointer. If the
///    pointee type is unsized, the pointer additionally stored the value of the metadata.
///
/// Computing a place may cause UB. One possibility is that the pointer used for a `Deref` may not
/// be suitably aligned. Another possibility is that the place is not in bounds, meaning it does not
/// point to an actual allocation.
///
/// However, if this is actually UB and when the UB kicks in is undecided. This is being discussed
/// in [UCG#319]. The options include that every place must obey those rules, that only some places
/// must obey them, or that places impose no rules of their own.
///
/// [UCG#319]: https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/319
