# We need to use a separate crate including library/proc_macro as opposed to a
# direct path dependency on library/proc_macro because doing the latter will
# cause two copies of libproc_macro.rlib to end up in the sysroot, breaking
# proc-macro crates. In addition it confuses the workspace_members function of
# bootstrap.
