/// Given the map `opaque_types` containing the opaque
/// `impl Trait` types whose underlying, hidden types are being
/// inferred, this method adds constraints to the regions
/// appearing in those underlying hidden types to ensure that they
/// at least do not refer to random scopes within the current
/// function. These constraints are not (quite) sufficient to
/// guarantee that the regions are actually legal values; that
/// final condition is imposed after region inference is done.
///
/// # The Problem
///
/// Let's work through an example to explain how it works. Assume
/// the current function is as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// fn foo<'a, 'b>(..) -> (impl Bar<'a>, impl Bar<'b>)
/// ```
///
/// Here, we have two `impl Trait` types whose values are being
/// inferred (the `impl Bar<'a>` and the `impl
/// Bar<'b>`). Conceptually, this is sugar for a setup where we
/// define underlying opaque types (`Foo1`, `Foo2`) and then, in
/// the return type of `foo`, we *reference* those definitions:
///
/// ```text
/// type Foo1<'x> = impl Bar<'x>;
/// type Foo2<'x> = impl Bar<'x>;
/// fn foo<'a, 'b>(..) -> (Foo1<'a>, Foo2<'b>) { .. }
///                    //  ^^^^ ^^
///                    //  |    |
///                    //  |    args
///                    //  def_id
/// ```
///
/// As indicating in the comments above, each of those references
/// is (in the compiler) basically generic parameters (`args`)
/// applied to the type of a suitable `def_id` (which identifies
/// `Foo1` or `Foo2`).
///
/// Now, at this point in compilation, what we have done is to
/// replace each of the references (`Foo1<'a>`, `Foo2<'b>`) with
/// fresh inference variables C1 and C2. We wish to use the values
/// of these variables to infer the underlying types of `Foo1` and
/// `Foo2`. That is, this gives rise to higher-order (pattern) unification
/// constraints like:
///
/// ```text
/// for<'a> (Foo1<'a> = C1)
/// for<'b> (Foo1<'b> = C2)
/// ```
///
/// For these equation to be satisfiable, the types `C1` and `C2`
/// can only refer to a limited set of regions. For example, `C1`
/// can only refer to `'static` and `'a`, and `C2` can only refer
/// to `'static` and `'b`. The job of this function is to impose that
/// constraint.
///
/// Up to this point, C1 and C2 are basically just random type
/// inference variables, and hence they may contain arbitrary
/// regions. In fact, it is fairly likely that they do! Consider
/// this possible definition of `foo`:
///
/// ```text
/// fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> (impl Bar<'a>, impl Bar<'b>) {
///         (&*x, &*y)
///     }
/// ```
///
/// Here, the values for the concrete types of the two impl
/// traits will include inference variables:
///
/// ```text
/// &'0 i32
/// &'1 i32
/// ```
///
/// Ordinarily, the subtyping rules would ensure that these are
/// sufficiently large. But since `impl Bar<'a>` isn't a specific
/// type per se, we don't get such constraints by default. This
/// is where this function comes into play. It adds extra
/// constraints to ensure that all the regions which appear in the
/// inferred type are regions that could validly appear.
///
/// This is actually a bit of a tricky constraint in general. We
/// want to say that each variable (e.g., `'0`) can only take on
/// values that were supplied as arguments to the opaque type
/// (e.g., `'a` for `Foo1<'a>`) or `'static`, which is always in
/// scope. We don't have a constraint quite of this kind in the current
/// region checker.
///
/// # The Solution
///
/// We generally prefer to make `<=` constraints, since they
/// integrate best into the region solver. To do that, we find the
/// "minimum" of all the arguments that appear in the args: that
/// is, some region which is less than all the others. In the case
/// of `Foo1<'a>`, that would be `'a` (it's the only choice, after
/// all). Then we apply that as a least bound to the variables
/// (e.g., `'a <= '0`).
///
/// In some cases, there is no minimum. Consider this example:
///
/// ```text
/// fn baz<'a, 'b>() -> impl Trait<'a, 'b> { ... }
/// ```
///
/// Here we would report a more complex "in constraint", like `'r
/// in ['a, 'b, 'static]` (where `'r` is some region appearing in
/// the hidden type).
///
/// # Constrain regions, not the hidden concrete type
///
/// Note that generating constraints on each region `Rc` is *not*
/// the same as generating an outlives constraint on `Tc` itself.
/// For example, if we had a function like this:
///
/// ```
/// # #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]
/// # fn main() {}
/// # trait Foo<'a> {}
/// # impl<'a, T> Foo<'a> for (&'a u32, T) {}
/// fn foo<'a, T>(x: &'a u32, y: T) -> impl Foo<'a> {
///   (x, y)
/// }
///
/// // Equivalent to:
/// # mod dummy { use super::*;
/// type FooReturn<'a, T> = impl Foo<'a>;
/// fn foo<'a, T>(x: &'a u32, y: T) -> FooReturn<'a, T> {
///   (x, y)
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// then the hidden type `Tc` would be `(&'0 u32, T)` (where `'0`
/// is an inference variable). If we generated a constraint that
/// `Tc: 'a`, then this would incorrectly require that `T: 'a` --
/// but this is not necessary, because the opaque type we
/// create will be allowed to reference `T`. So we only generate a
/// constraint that `'0: 'a`.
