//! Check if it's even possible to satisfy the 'where' clauses
//! for this item.
//!
//! It's possible to `#!feature(trivial_bounds)]` to write
//! a function with impossible to satisfy clauses, e.g.:
//! `fn foo() where String: Copy {}`.
//!
//! We don't usually need to worry about this kind of case,
//! since we would get a compilation error if the user tried
//! to call it. However, since we optimize even without any
//! calls to the function, we need to make sure that it even
//! makes sense to try to evaluate the body.
//!
//! If there are unsatisfiable where clauses, then all bets are
//! off, and we just give up.
//!
//! We manually filter the predicates, skipping anything that's not
//! "global". We are in a potentially generic context
//! (e.g. we are evaluating a function without instantiating generic
//! parameters, so this filtering serves two purposes:
//!
//! 1. We skip evaluating any predicates that we would
//! never be able prove are unsatisfiable (e.g. `<T as Foo>`
//! 2. We avoid trying to normalize predicates involving generic
//! parameters (e.g. `<T as Foo>::MyItem`). This can confuse
//! the normalization code (leading to cycle errors), since
//! it's usually never invoked in this way.
