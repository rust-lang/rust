//! Propagates assignment destinations backwards in the CFG to eliminate redundant assignments.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! MIR building can insert a lot of redundant copies, and Rust code in general often tends to move
//! values around a lot. The result is a lot of assignments of the form `dest = {move} src;` in MIR.
//! MIR building for constants in particular tends to create additional locals that are only used
//! inside a single block to shuffle a value around unnecessarily.
//!
//! LLVM by itself is not good enough at eliminating these redundant copies (eg. see
//! <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32966>), so this leaves some performance on the table
//! that we can regain by implementing an optimization for removing these assign statements in rustc
//! itself. When this optimization runs fast enough, it can also speed up the constant evaluation
//! and code generation phases of rustc due to the reduced number of statements and locals.
//!
//! # The Optimization
//!
//! Conceptually, this optimization is "destination propagation". It is similar to the Named Return
//! Value Optimization, or NRVO, known from the C++ world, except that it isn't limited to return
//! values or the return place `_0`. On a very high level, independent of the actual implementation
//! details, it does the following:
//!
//! 1) Identify `dest = src;` statements with values for `dest` and `src` whose storage can soundly
//!    be merged.
//! 2) Replace all mentions of `src` with `dest` ("unifying" them and propagating the destination
//!    backwards).
//! 3) Delete the `dest = src;` statement (by making it a `nop`).
//!
//! Step 1) is by far the hardest, so it is explained in more detail below.
//!
//! ## Soundness
//!
//! We have a pair of places `p` and `q`, whose memory we would like to merge. In order for this to
//! be sound, we need to check a number of conditions:
//!
//! * `p` and `q` must both be *constant* - it does not make much sense to talk about merging them
//!   if they do not consistently refer to the same place in memory. This is satisfied if they do
//!   not contain any indirection through a pointer or any indexing projections.
//!
//! * `p` and `q` must have the **same type**. If we replace a local with a subtype or supertype,
//!   we may end up with a different vtable for that local. See the `subtyping-impacts-selection`
//!   tests for an example where that causes issues.
//!
//! * We need to make sure that the goal of "merging the memory" is actually structurally possible
//!   in MIR. For example, even if all the other conditions are satisfied, there is no way to
//!   "merge" `_5.foo` and `_6.bar`. For now, we ensure this by requiring that both `p` and `q` are
//!   locals with no further projections. Future iterations of this pass should improve on this.
//!
//! * Finally, we want `p` and `q` to use the same memory - however, we still need to make sure that
//!   each of them has enough "ownership" of that memory to continue "doing its job." More
//!   precisely, what we will check is that whenever the program performs a write to `p`, then it
//!   does not currently care about what the value in `q` is (and vice versa). We formalize the
//!   notion of "does not care what the value in `q` is" by checking the *liveness* of `q`.
//!
//!   Because of the difficulty of computing liveness of places that have their address taken, we do
//!   not even attempt to do it. Any places that are in a local that has its address taken is
//!   excluded from the optimization.
//!
//! The first two conditions are simple structural requirements on the `Assign` statements that can
//! be trivially checked. The third requirement however is more difficult and costly to check.
//!
//! ## Future Improvements
//!
//! There are a number of ways in which this pass could be improved in the future:
//!
//! * Merging storage liveness ranges instead of removing storage statements completely. This may
//!   improve stack usage.
//!
//! * Allow merging locals into places with projections, eg `_5` into `_6.foo`.
//!
//! * Liveness analysis with more precision than whole locals at a time. The smaller benefit of this
//!   is that it would allow us to dest prop at "sub-local" levels in some cases. The bigger benefit
//!   of this is that such liveness analysis can report more accurate results about whole locals at
//!   a time. For example, consider:
//!
//!   ```ignore (syntax-highlighting-only)
//!   _1 = u;
//!   // unrelated code
//!   _1.f1 = v;
//!   _2 = _1.f1;
//!   ```
//!
//!   Because the current analysis only thinks in terms of locals, it does not have enough
//!   information to report that `_1` is dead in the "unrelated code" section.
//!
//! * Liveness analysis enabled by alias analysis. This would allow us to not just bail on locals
//!   that ever have their address taken. Of course that requires actually having alias analysis
//!   (and a model to build it on), so this might be a bit of a ways off.
//!
//! * Various perf improvements. There are a bunch of comments in here marked `PERF` with ideas for
//!   how to do things more efficiently. However, the complexity of the pass as a whole should be
//!   kept in mind.
//!
//! ## Previous Work
//!
//! A [previous attempt][attempt 1] at implementing an optimization like this turned out to be a
//! significant regression in compiler performance. Fixing the regressions introduced a lot of
//! undesirable complexity to the implementation.
//!
//! A [subsequent approach][attempt 2] tried to avoid the costly computation by limiting itself to
//! acyclic CFGs, but still turned out to be far too costly to run due to suboptimal performance
//! within individual basic blocks, requiring a walk across the entire block for every assignment
//! found within the block. For the `tuple-stress` benchmark, which has 458745 statements in a
//! single block, this proved to be far too costly.
//!
//! [Another approach after that][attempt 3] was much closer to correct, but had some soundness
//! issues - it was failing to consider stores outside live ranges, and failed to uphold some of the
//! requirements that MIR has for non-overlapping places within statements. However, it also had
//! performance issues caused by `O(lÂ² * s)` runtime, where `l` is the number of locals and `s` is
//! the number of statements and terminators.
//!
//! Since the first attempt at this, the compiler has improved dramatically, and new analysis
//! frameworks have been added that should make this approach viable without requiring a limited
//! approach that only works for some classes of CFGs:
//! - rustc now has a powerful dataflow analysis framework that can handle forwards and backwards
//!   analyses efficiently.
//! - Layout optimizations for coroutines have been added to improve code generation for
//!   async/await, which are very similar in spirit to what this optimization does.
//!
//! Also, rustc now has a simple NRVO pass (see `nrvo.rs`), which handles a subset of the cases that
//! this destination propagation pass handles, proving that similar optimizations can be performed
//! on MIR.
//!
//! ## Pre/Post Optimization
//!
//! It is recommended to run `SimplifyCfg` and then `SimplifyLocals` some time after this pass, as
//! it replaces the eliminated assign statements with `nop`s and leaves unused locals behind.
