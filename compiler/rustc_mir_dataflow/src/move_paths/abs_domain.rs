//! The move-analysis portion of borrowck needs to work in an abstract
//! domain of lifted `Place`s. Most of the `Place` variants fall into a
//! one-to-one mapping between the concrete and abstract (e.g., a
//! field-deref on a local variable, `x.field`, has the same meaning
//! in both domains). Indexed projections are the exception: `a[x]`
//! needs to be treated as mapping to the same move path as `a[y]` as
//! well as `a[13]`, etc.
//!
//! (In theory, the analysis could be extended to work with sets of
//! paths, so that `a[0]` and `a[13]` could be kept distinct, while
//! `a[x]` would still overlap them both. But that is not this
//! representation does today.)
