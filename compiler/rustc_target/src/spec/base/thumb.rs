// These `thumbv*` targets cover the ARM Cortex-M family of processors which are widely used in
// microcontrollers. Namely, all these processors:
//
// - Cortex-M0
// - Cortex-M0+
// - Cortex-M1
// - Cortex-M3
// - Cortex-M4(F)
// - Cortex-M7(F)
// - Cortex-M23
// - Cortex-M33
//
// We have opted for these instead of one target per processor (e.g., `cortex-m0`, `cortex-m3`,
// etc) because the differences between some processors like the cortex-m0 and cortex-m1 are almost
// nonexistent from the POV of codegen so it doesn't make sense to have separate targets for them.
// And if differences exist between two processors under the same target, rustc flags can be used to
// optimize for one processor or the other.
//
// Also, we have not chosen a single target (`arm-none-eabi`) like GCC does because this makes
// difficult to integrate Rust code and C code. Targeting the Cortex-M4 requires different gcc flags
// than the ones you would use for the Cortex-M0 and with a single target it'd be impossible to
// differentiate one processor from the other.
//
// About arm vs thumb in the name. The Cortex-M devices only support the Thumb instruction set,
// which is more compact (higher code density), and not the ARM instruction set. That's why LLVM
// triples use thumb instead of arm. We follow suit because having thumb in the name let us
// differentiate these targets from our other `arm(v7)-*-*-gnueabi(hf)` targets in the context of
// build scripts / gcc flags.
