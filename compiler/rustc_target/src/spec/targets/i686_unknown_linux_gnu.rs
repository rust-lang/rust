    // will complain that the chosen ABI cannot be realized with the given CPU features.
    // Also note that x86 without SSE2 is *not* considered a Tier 1 target by the Rust project, and
    // it has some known floating-point correctness issues mostly caused by a lack of people caring
    // for LLVM's x87 support (double-rounding, value truncation; see
    // <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114479> for details). This can lead to incorrect
    // math (Rust generally promises exact math, so this can break code in unexpected ways) and it
    // can lead to memory safety violations if floating-point values are used e.g. to access an
    // array. If users run into such issues and report bugs upstream and then it turns out that the
    // bugs are caused by distribution patches, that leads to confusion and frustration.
