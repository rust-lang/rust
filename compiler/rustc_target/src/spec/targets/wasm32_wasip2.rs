//! The `wasm32-wasip2` target is the next evolution of the
//! wasm32-wasip1 target. While the wasi specification is still under
//! active development, the preview 2 iteration is considered an "island
//! of stability" that should allow users to rely on it indefinitely.
//!
//! The `wasi` target is a proposal to define a standardized set of WebAssembly
//! component imports that allow it to interoperate with the host system in a
//! standardized way. This set of imports is intended to empower WebAssembly
//! binaries with host capabilities such as filesystem access, network access, etc.
//!
//! Wasi Preview 2 relies on the WebAssembly component model which is an extension of
//! the core WebAssembly specification which allows interoperability between WebAssembly
//! modules (known as "components") through high-level, shared-nothing APIs instead of the
//! low-level, shared-everything linear memory model of the core WebAssembly specification.
//!
//! You can see more about wasi at <https://wasi.dev> and the component model at
//! <https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model>.
