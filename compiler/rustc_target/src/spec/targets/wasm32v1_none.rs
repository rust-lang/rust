//! A "bare wasm" target representing a WebAssembly output that does not import
//! anything from its environment and also specifies an _upper_ bound on the set
//! of WebAssembly proposals that are supported.
//!
//! It's equivalent to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target with the additional
//! flags `-Ctarget-cpu=mvp` and `-Ctarget-feature=+mutable-globals`. This
//! enables just the features specified in <https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/>
//!
//! This is a _separate target_ because using `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with
//! those target flags doesn't automatically rebuild libcore / liballoc with
//! them, and in order to get those libraries rebuilt you need to use the
//! nightly Rust feature `-Zbuild-std`. This target is for people who want to
//! use stable Rust, and target a stable set pf WebAssembly features.
