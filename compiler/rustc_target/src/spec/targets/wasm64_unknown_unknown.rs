//! A "bare wasm" target representing a WebAssembly output that makes zero
//! assumptions about its environment.
//!
//! The `wasm64-unknown-unknown` target is intended to encapsulate use cases
//! that do not rely on any imported functionality. The binaries generated are
//! entirely self-contained by default when using the standard library. Although
//! the standard library is available, most of it returns an error immediately
//! (e.g. trying to create a TCP stream or something like that).
