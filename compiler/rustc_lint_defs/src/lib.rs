/// /// and also include suggestions on how the user should fix the problem.
/// /// Try to keep the text simple enough that a beginner can understand,
/// /// and include links to other documentation for terminology that a
/// /// beginner may not be familiar with. If this is "allow" by default,
/// /// it should explain why (are there false positives or other issues?). If
/// /// this is a future-incompatible lint, it should say so, with text that
/// /// looks roughly like this:
/// ///
/// /// This is a [future-incompatible] lint to transition this to a hard
/// /// error in the future. See [issue #xxxxx] for more details.
/// ///
/// /// [issue #xxxxx]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/xxxxx
/// ```
///
/// The `{{produces}}` tag will be automatically replaced with the output from
/// the example by the build system. If the lint example is too complex to run
/// as a simple example (for example, it needs an extern crate), mark the code
/// block with `ignore` and manually replace the `{{produces}}` line with the
/// expected output in a `text` code block.
///
/// If this is a rustdoc-only lint, then only include a brief introduction
/// with a link with the text `[rustdoc book]` so that the validator knows
/// that this is for rustdoc only (see BROKEN_INTRA_DOC_LINKS as an example).
///
/// Commands to view and test the documentation:
///
/// * `./x.py doc --stage=1 src/doc/rustc --open`: Builds the rustc book and opens it.
/// * `./x.py test src/tools/lint-docs`: Validates that the lint docs have the
///   correct style, and that the code example actually emits the expected
///   lint.
///
/// If you have already built the compiler, and you want to make changes to
/// just the doc comments, then use the `--keep-stage=0` flag with the above
/// commands to avoid rebuilding the compiler.
