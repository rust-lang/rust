    /// `const` is mutated, but the original `const` is not. Each time you
    /// refer to the `const` by name (such as `FOO` in the example above), a
    /// separate copy of the value is inlined at that location.

    ///
    /// * First, always reconsider using mutable globals, as they can be
    ///   difficult to use correctly, and can make the code more difficult to
    ///   use or understand.
    /// * If you are trying to perform a one-time initialization of a global:
    ///     * If the value can be computed at compile-time, consider using
    ///       const-compatible values (see [Constant Evaluation]).
    ///     * For more complex single-initialization cases, consider using
    ///       [`std::sync::LazyLock`].
    /// * If you truly need a mutable global, consider using a [`static`],
    ///   which has a variety of options:
    ///   * Simple data types can be directly defined and mutated with an
    ///     [`atomic`] type.
    ///   * More complex types can be placed in a synchronization primitive
    ///     like a [`Mutex`], which can be initialized with one of the options
    ///     listed above.
    ///   * A [mutable `static`] is a low-level primitive, requiring unsafe.

    /// before Edition 2024 so that they are dropped only after dropping local variables.
    /// Edition 2024 introduces a new rule with drop orders for them,
    /// so that they are dropped first before dropping local variables.

    /// implementation of the `Drop` trait on the type, with exceptions including `Vec`,
    /// `Box`, `Rc`, `BTreeMap` and `HashMap` that are marked by the compiler otherwise
    /// so long that the generic types have no significant destructor recursively.
    /// In other words, a type has a significant drop destructor when it has a `Drop` implementation
    /// or its destructor invokes a significant destructor on a type.
    /// Since we cannot completely reason about the change by just inspecting the existence of
    /// a significant destructor, this lint remains only a suggestion and is set to `allow` by default.
    ///
    /// This lint only points out the issue with `Droppy`, which will be dropped before `another_droppy`
    /// does in Edition 2024.
    /// No fix will be proposed by this lint.
    /// However, the most probable fix is to hoist `Droppy` into its own local variable binding.

    /// struct Droppy(i32);
    /// impl Droppy {
    ///     fn get(&self) -> i32 {
    ///         self.0
