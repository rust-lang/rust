#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler

This is because it was too specific to the `inline` attribute.
Similar diagnostics occur for other attributes too.
The example here will now emit `E0805`

The `inline` attribute was malformed.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0805
#[inline()] // error: expected one argument
pub fn something() {}

fn main() {}
```

The parenthesized `inline` attribute requires the parameter to be specified:

```
#[inline(always)]
fn something() {}
```

or:

```
#[inline(never)]
fn something() {}
```

Alternatively, a paren-less version of the attribute may be used to hint the
compiler about inlining opportunity:

```
#[inline]
fn something() {}
```

For more information see the [`inline` attribute][inline-attribute] section
of the Reference.
