#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

The `ffi_const` attribute was used on something other than a foreign function
declaration.

Erroneous code example:

```ignore (no longer emitted)
#![feature(ffi_const)]

#[unsafe(ffi_const)] // error!
pub fn foo() {}
# fn main() {}
```

The `ffi_const` attribute can only be used on foreign function declarations
which have no side effects except for their return value:

```
#![feature(ffi_const)]

extern "C" {
    #[unsafe(ffi_const)] // ok!
    pub fn strlen(s: *const i8) -> i32;
}
# fn main() {}
```

You can get more information about it in the [unstable Rust Book].
