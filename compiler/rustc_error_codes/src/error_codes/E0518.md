#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

An `#[inline(..)]` attribute was incorrectly placed on something other than a
function or method.

Example of erroneous code:

```ignore (no longer emitted)
#[inline(always)]
struct Foo;

#[inline(never)]
impl Foo {
    // ...
}
```

`#[inline]` hints the compiler whether or not to attempt to inline a method or
function. By default, the compiler does a pretty good job of figuring this out
itself, but if you feel the need for annotations, `#[inline(always)]` and
`#[inline(never)]` can override or force the compiler's decision.

If you wish to apply this attribute to all methods in an impl, manually annotate
each method; it is not possible to annotate the entire impl with an `#[inline]`
attribute.
