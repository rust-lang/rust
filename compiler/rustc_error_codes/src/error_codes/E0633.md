#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

The `unwind` attribute was malformed.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail
#![feature(unwind_attributes)]

#[unwind()] // error: expected one argument
pub extern "C" fn something() {}

fn main() {}
```

The `#[unwind]` attribute should be used as follows:

- `#[unwind(aborts)]` -- specifies that if a non-Rust ABI function
  should abort the process if it attempts to unwind. This is the safer
  and preferred option.

- `#[unwind(allowed)]` -- specifies that a non-Rust ABI function
  should be allowed to unwind. This can easily result in Undefined
  Behavior (UB), so be careful.

NB. The default behavior here is "allowed", but this is unspecified
and likely to change in the future.
