A non-structural-match type was used as the type of a const generic parameter.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0741
#![feature(const_generics)]

struct A;

struct B<const X: A>; // error!
```

Only structural-match types (that is, types that derive `PartialEq` and `Eq`)
may be used as the types of const generic parameters.

To fix the previous code example, we derive `PartialEq` and `Eq`:

```
#![feature(const_generics)]

#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)] // We derive both traits here.
struct A;

struct B<const X: A>; // ok!
```
