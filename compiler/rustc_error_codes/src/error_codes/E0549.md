A `deprecated` attribute wasn't paired with a `stable`/`unstable` attribute with
`#![feature(staged_api)]` enabled.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0549
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![allow(internal_features)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[deprecated(
    since = "1.0.1",
    note = "explanation for deprecation"
)] // invalid
fn _deprecated_fn() {}
```

To fix this issue, you need to add also an attribute `stable` or `unstable`.
Example:

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![allow(internal_features)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]
#[deprecated(
    since = "1.0.1",
    note = "explanation for deprecation"
)] // ok!
fn _deprecated_fn() {}
```
