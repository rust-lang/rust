The `issue` value is incorrect in a stability attribute.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0545
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![allow(internal_features)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[unstable(feature = "_unstable_fn", issue = "0")] // invalid
fn _unstable_fn() {}

#[rustc_const_unstable(feature = "_unstable_const_fn", issue = "0")] // invalid
const fn _unstable_const_fn() {}
```

To fix this issue, you need to provide a correct value in the `issue` field.
Example:

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![allow(internal_features)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "test")]

#[unstable(feature = "_unstable_fn", issue = "none")] // ok!
fn _unstable_fn() {}

#[rustc_const_unstable(feature = "_unstable_const_fn", issue = "1")] // ok!
const fn _unstable_const_fn() {}
```
