#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler

More than one `deprecated` attribute has been put on an item.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail
#[deprecated(note = "because why not?")]
#[deprecated(note = "right?")] // error!
fn the_banished() {}
```

The `deprecated` attribute can only be present **once** on an item.

```
#[deprecated(note = "because why not, right?")]
fn the_banished() {} // ok!
```
