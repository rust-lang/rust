#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

The length of the platform-intrinsic function `simd_shuffle` wasn't specified.

Erroneous code example:

```ignore (no longer emitted)
#![feature(platform_intrinsics)]

extern "platform-intrinsic" {
    fn simd_shuffle<A,B>(a: A, b: A, c: [u32; 8]) -> B;
    // error: invalid `simd_shuffle`, needs length: `simd_shuffle`
}
```

The `simd_shuffle` function needs the length of the array passed as
last parameter in its name. Example:

```ignore (no longer compiles)
#![feature(platform_intrinsics)]

extern "platform-intrinsic" {
    fn simd_shuffle8<A,B>(a: A, b: A, c: [u32; 8]) -> B;
}
```
