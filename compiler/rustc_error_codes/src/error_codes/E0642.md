Trait methods cannot take patterns as arguments.

Traits cannot control the way in which implementations take arguments, only the
types of those arguments. A pattern here has no effect, because the
implementation can bind its arguments however it would like.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0642,edition2024
trait Foo {
    fn foo((x, y): (i32, i32)); // error: patterns aren't allowed
                                //        in trait methods
}
```

You can instead use a single name for the argument:

```
trait Foo {
    fn foo(x_and_y: (i32, i32)); // ok!
}
```

And you can use patterns in its implementations:

impl Foo for Bar {
    fn foo((x, y): (i32, i32)) { /* ... */ } // ok!
}
