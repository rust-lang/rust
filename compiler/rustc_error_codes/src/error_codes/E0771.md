#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler

A non-`'static` lifetime was used in a const generic. This is currently not
allowed.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0770
#![feature(adt_const_params, unsized_const_params)]

fn function_with_str<'a, const STRING: &'a str>() {} // error!
```

To fix this issue, the lifetime in the const generic need to be changed to
`'static`:

```
#![feature(adt_const_params, unsized_const_params)]

fn function_with_str<const STRING: &'static str>() {} // ok!
```
