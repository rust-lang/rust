#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

`async` non-`move` closures with parameters are currently not supported.

Erroneous code example:

```edition2018
fn main() {
    let add_one = async |num: u8| {
        num + 1
    };
}
```

`async` with non-move is currently not supported with the current
version, you can use successfully by using move:

```edition2018
fn main() {
    let add_one = async move |num: u8| { // ok!
        num + 1
    };
}
```
