The value of `N` that was specified for `repr(align(N))` was greater than the
PE-COFF limit (8192 bytes).

Erroneous code example:

```ignore (fails only on PE-COFF targets)
#[repr(align(16384))] // error: alignment must not be greater than 8192 bytes
                      // for COFF targets
enum Foo {
    Bar(u64),
}
```
